the instruments the human eye an extraordinary organ the eye is the organ that allows us to see light enters through the cornea and is projected onto the retina which consists of cells that are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation from there the light signals are converted into electrical impulses that are transmitted to the brain along the optic nerve once the brain has received the pulses it transforms the information into an image the human eye is spherical and its internal parts are transparent so that the maximum amount of light can reach the retina the cornea surrounds and protects the eye it is made of transparent gellike material that helps converge light rays onto the retina the role of the iris is to control the quantity of light that passes through the cornea keeping it at a fairly constant level too much light can damage the retina whereas not enough will prevent a person from seeing properly its centre the pupil allows just the right amount of light to pass through so that we can see this is why the pupil contracts when there is too much light like when the sun blinds us to prevent excess light rays from reaching the retina and contracts when there is not enough light like when we walk into a darkened room to allow in the most light possible immediately behind the iris is the lens it is a true lens in that it converges light rays passing through the eye onto the retina the lens of the eye is also flexible and can deform itself to improve the convergence of light on the other hand they are not very sensitive to light rays and need a lot of light to work the rods are very sensitive to light and enable us to see when it is dark they are not however capable of distinguishing different colours and details and this causes the poor colour contrast between objects that we observe when the lighting is dim in all hundreds of millions of cells must work together in our eyes and brain in order for us to see astronomers « return to the instruments the first instruments the transit and the sextant many different astronomical instruments have been used throughout the ages two stand out as having played particularly important historical roles the transit and the sextant such diverse fields as stellar cartography mapping navigation and the determination of time have all progressed significantly thanks to these instruments the transit is used to measure the precise moment that a celestial object passes through its highest point in the sky also know as the meridian used since ancient egyptian time the modern form of this instrument consists of a telescope that only moves vertically a dial on one side graduated from to degrees is used to measure the inclination of the telescope when the celestial object in question passes through the meridian the observer notes its angle above the horizon at the precise moment of its passing these two measurements provide the coordinates the position of the object in the celestial sphere a map of the sky can be thus be assembled bit by bit and used to create tables that give the positions of stars planets the moon and so on for the purposes of navigation or determining the exact time the sextant is an instrument that can be used to determine the angle between a celestial object and the horizon used in conjunction with the transit tables it is a simple matter to calculate the latitude of one’s position the predecessors of the sextant included the astrolab and the octant both of which operated on the same principle the modern version of the sextant was independently invented in the ’s by john hadley in england and thomas godfrey in the united states « return to the instruments next previous © an original idea and a realization of the astrolab of montmégantic national park astronomers « return to the instruments refracting telescopes concentrating light by refraction through lenses the assyrians people who lived in a region that is known today as iraq were perhaps the first to have used lenses to magnify objects possibly around bc the evidence is a rock crystal discovered by the english archaeologist john layard in during the excavation of the ancient city of nimrud the crystal was cut and polished into the shape of a lens however it is not entirely certain that it was used as a magnifying lens and not as jewellery or for some other purpose evidence that lenses were in use during the first century bc can be found in the records of the roman authors pliny and senecio who reported that an engraver at pompeii used a lens to help him in his work other historical evidence reveals that the arabs were using lenses by the year ad as were the vikings around the year it is difficult to determine when a refracting telescope was first assembled using lenses the first person to do so with certainty and thus the person to be credited with its invention was the english mathematician leonard digges who constructed a refracting telescope sometime between and to assist with his topographic surveys leonard digges – or perhaps his son the english astronomer thomas digges – was also the first to turn a refractor towards the sky to study celestial objects the instrument did not become widely known to the public until when hans lippershey or lipperhey a dutch optician of german origin began to make and sell telescopes lippershey applied for a patent for what he claimed was his own invention but was refused on the grounds that the device was already in existence the english mathematician thomas harriot was the first to study the moon in detail using an astronomical telescope in and it is known with certainty that this occurred several months before galileo galilei the famous italian physicist did the same galilei however was the first to have published his observations in a book entitled the starry messenger translated from latin his book revolutionized our concept of the universe the first refracting telescopes consisted of two lenses separated by some distance within a closed tube the larger of the two is the objective or primary lens and the second is the ocular the role of the lenses is to concentrate light rays into a single point – the focal point – so as to obtain a sharper magnified image it is the glass of the lens that allows light to be concentrated this phenomenon is known as refraction lenses to be effective in a telescope must be shaped so that all the refracted light rays converge in a single point unfortunately we now know today that it is impossible to focus light from an object into a single point using only one lens there are several types of aberrations the main ones being chromatic and spherical all types of aberration cause deformation of the image transmitted by the telescope chromatic aberration occurs because light rays of different colours are not all bent by the same amount as they pass through a lens consequently it is impossible to concentrate the rays into a single point chromatic aberration causes coloured fringes to appear around the image spherical aberration is due to the shape of the lens a lens is nothing more than a piece of glass with each surface shaped like a portion of a sphere unfortunately a sphere is not the best shape for concentrating light rays into a single point but is the easiest shape to make when grinding and polishing glass spherical aberration causes images to be blurred these days refracting telescopes are made using several lenses that are designed and put together in ways that minimize the problems caused by aberrations video sequence peter gordon martin explains what aberration is video sequence jaymie mark matthews explains what a reflector is astronomers « return to the instruments reflecting telescopes concentrating light using mirrors in contrast to a refracting telescope which uses lenses to enlarge images reflecting telescopes also known as reflectors use mirrors to accomplish the same goal the advantages are numerous manufacturing mirrors is simpler and less costly than lenses there are less aberrationrelated problems and the main mirror can be supported from below today the reflecting telescope is considered as one of the most powerful scientific instruments ever invented sometime between and the english mathematician leonard digges constructed the first reflecting telescope using a mirror and a lens in his son thomas an astronomer used it to defend the idea that the universe is infinite which was a revolutionary concept at the time nevertheless it would be another years before the reflecting telescope was widely used in the scottish mathematician and astronomer james gregory published his book optima promota in which he included the design for a new type of compact reflecting telescope the english physicist robert hooke built the actual instrument several years later only a short time before isaac newton developed his own telescope in the principle behind newton’s telescope was so simple that we still use it today it consists of two mirrors the primary and the secondary the primary mirror has a parabolic shape and serves to collect light from the object of interest the secondary mirror smaller than the primary is flat and inclined in such a way as to reflect light from the primary mirror towards the ocular and the observer in the catholic priest and french teacher laurent cassegrain invented a new type of reflecting telescope that he described in an unpublished manuscript the cassegrain telescope consisted of a primary parabolic mirror which collected light from the celestial object and a secondary mirror which faced the primary mirror and concentrated the reflected light towards the observer by directing it through a hole in the centre of the primary mirror the image could therefore be viewed from behind the telescope and not from the side as with newton’s design the big advantage to the cassegrain design is its compact size which makes it portable moreover heavy instruments can be installed at its based today the cassegrain reflector is the most commonly used type of telescope video sequence john barrie hutchings explains what a refractor is astronomers « return to the instruments invisible light collectors seeing the invisible refracting and reflecting telescopes are used to collect and study visible light although visible light provides valuable information it only represents a tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to see the rest of the spectrum which consists of invisible colours researchers need to use collectors that are capable of detecting wavelengths that correspond to the type of light they wish to study for the infrared domain the parabolic mirror of a reflecting telescope remains the ideal means by which to collect and concentrate the light rays because the light being collected is invisible the human observer is replaced by an infrared detector at the mirror’s focal point its purpose is to measure the intensity of the infrared rays unfortunately the situation is considerably more complex for the mid and farinfrared domains one of the complications for detecting infrared sources in space is that the reflecting telescope collects a lot of background infrared light from the atmosphere from any human observers present in the room and from the telescope itself in addition atmospheric water vapour absorbs a large part of the infrared rays coming from space which makes data collection difficult – or even impossible – at some wavelengths to overcome these problems detectors are cooled to very low temperatures sometimes down to °c and the telescopes are placed at the highest elevations possible where the air is drier another solution is to put them directly into space orbiting earth the great interest for astronomers in observing the infrared light of the universe is due to its powers of penetration infrared waves are capable of passing through dust allowing us to see regions that are otherwise impenetrable to visible light such as the interiors of nebulas at longer wavelengths in the microwave domain absorption by water is a persistent problem and the best solutions are to collect data from high elevations or satellites in order for light rays to be concentrated at the focal point of a reflecting telescope the size of the irregularities in the curve of the parabolic collector must be smaller than the wavelength of the light being collected consequently it is not necessary to use a highly polished reflecting surface like a mirror for light with very long wavelengths like microwaves instead a simple metal dish will suffice microwaves are of immense interest to astronomers cosmic background radiation – that amazing first light emitted when the universe was only a few hundred thousand years old – exists mainly in the form of microwaves radio waves which have even longer and less energetic wavelengths than microwaves are typically collected using large metal dishes radio waves are produced by supernova remnants and by electrons passing through the magnetic fields of distant radio galaxies for light with wavelengths that are shorter than those of visible light like ultraviolet rays it is possible to use optical telescopes unfortunately for astronomers but fortunately for human beings most ultraviolet light is absorbed by the ozone layer before reaching earth’s surface it is therefore necessary to use satellites for ultraviolet studies ultraviolet light is the most abundant type of energy generated by very hot stars satellites must also be used to study xrays and gamma rays which have wavelengths that are even shorter and more energetic than those of ultraviolet rays these light rays are so energetic however that they can easily pass through mirrors special collectors must be used to detect them most xrays are emitted by pockets of hot gases found between galaxies and near black holes gamma rays are mainly found in the vicinity of supernova explosions astronomers « return to the instruments photographic plates memorizing light in the early days of astronomy astronomers had to draw their observations on paper the method was of course imperfect and prone not only to errors in reproduction but also to the unintentional omission of important details the invention of photography which could accurately transfer images to paper was quickly adopted as a convenient solution in fact astronomers began using photography almost as soon as it was invented the principle behind photography is the use of lightsensitive chemicals like silver salts these are dispersed in a gel to create a mixture known as emulsion once the emulsion is exposed to light the lightsensitive chemicals react and become opaque to varying degrees depending on the amount of exposure the result is a photographic image it was in that the french inventor joseph nicéphore niépce first began thinking of a method to record light he started experimenting in and succeeded in setting images on paper in in he made the first permanent photo by using a sheet of polished tin coated with a petroleum derivative called bitumen of judea a type of tar unaware of the progress made by niépce the british scientist william henry fox talbot began his own set of experiments in and recorded images on paper in his process became known in and he obtained a patent in the french inventor hippolyte bayard began his experiments before but it was only in that he is known with certainty to have successfully recorded an image his process was publicized in and of all the other methods developed before it was bayard’s that produced the best and most detailed images in after continuing the work of his associate niépce the french painter and inventor louis jacques mandé daguerre took an image of the moon at the request of the french astronomer dominique françois jean arago daguerre’s technique which used copper plates coated with silver was made known to the public in and the images were called daguerreotypes it would become the most widely used method after the german astronomer johann heinrich von mädler came up with term photography in by combining photo from the greek word for light and graphy to write the word was quickly popularized by the british astronomer john frederick william herschel who is often mistakenly given credit for inventing the word in the american doctor and chemist john william draper produced a daguerreotype of the moon the first astronomical photograph ever created in north america the french optician noël marie paymal lerebours photographed the sun for the first time in but no details were visible in two americans – astronomer william cranch bond and photographer john adams whipple – produced the first photograph of a star when they made a daguerreotype of vega also known as alpha lyrae also in the english inventor frederick scott archer came up with the wet collodion process collodion is a viscous thick liquid that archer used to coat glass plates by producing a photographic negative on glass rather than on paper the resulting images were much sharper and could be made much larger hence the great interest for astronomers archer published his technique in and astronomers rapidly adopted the use of photographic plates in using this method george phillips bond of the united states was the first to photograph a double star mizar and alcor in the american inventor george eastman who would go on to found the eastmankodak company in built a machine for coating photographic plates with emulsion that allowed photographs to be produced in great quantity during the first few decades of the ’s the eastman company worked in collaboration with several astronomical observatories to develop emulsions that were increasingly sensitive to light the photographic plate thus became the imaging medium par excellence in the th century astrophotography experienced its golden age between the ’s and thanks to colour filters images produced from photographic plates could also be presented in colours which greatly increased the public’s interest in astronomy astronomers « return to the instruments filters blocking some light to reveal more details in the scottish physicist james clerk maxwell created the first colour photograph he made the photo by first placing a black and white photographic plate behind a plate of red glass he then repeated the procedure with a green plate and then blue he projected the three negatives on a screen using glass plates in the corresponding colours and thus obtained a colour image today we call maxwell’s red green and blue glass plates filters a filter allows some colours to be blocked which emphasizes the remaining colours that pass through by carefully choosing filters it is possible to reveal details that would otherwise be difficult to see in frederick charles luther wratten of england founded one of the first companies to supply photographic material in he developed a system of numbercoded colour filters that quickly became the standard in the photography industry the eastmankodak company bought wratten’s company in and continued to use his filter system after acquiring wratten’s company eastmankodak began to manufacture filters specifically designed for astronomy work the company continues to make them today and surprisingly still uses wratten’s original numbering system the market is shared by other companies – like lumicon meade and orion – who also design filters for professional and amateur astronomers some filters are designed to block out the artificial light of fluorescent and incandescent lighting this serves to increase the contrast of many celestial objects video sequence mariemaude de denusbaillargeon explains what an optic filter is astronomers « return to the instruments photometers measuring the brightness of celestial objects a photometer is an instrument that measures and quantifies the brightness of a celestial body a galaxy star comet or planet for example the brightness depends on the luminosity of the object and on the distance that separates the object from the photometer as well as the amount of matter between the two that can obscure the object a very luminous star could appear dim if it is far enough away or is partly obscured by gaseous clouds and interstellar dust a photometer has several applications in astronomy in the case of a star for example a photometer can be used to determine its temperature its distance and even its age photometers can also be used to determine if planets are orbiting about certain stars let’s take a look at the case of temperature a hot star will emit a lot of light in the blue portion of the spectrum relatively energetic wavelengths whereas a cold star will mainly emit red light less energetic wavelengths by using a photometer to measure the amount of light emitted at blue and red wavelengths that is the colour of the star temperature can be estimated the brightness of a celestial object is a measure of its luminous flux the amount of incoming light the luminous flux of a star is dependent on a combination of temperature the size of its surface and its distance from earth if we know its temperature by its colour and its distance by other methods we can calculate its surface area and thus its size astronomers can use photometers to precisely measure the amount of light emitted at specific wavelengths that correspond to the emission lines produced by heated chemical elements this information is used to establish the chemical composition of a star many different methods have been developed for estimating the brightness of celestial bodies all the initial attempts however had a major drawback the estimate had to be made visually and could vary greatly from one observer to another in the british astronomer john frederick william herschel changed all that herschel invented a photometer astrometer as he called it that allowed the observer to visually compare the brightness of stars using a scale based on the reduced telescopic image of the moon it was the first true photometer in the french astronomer dominique françois jean arago proposed the design of a new photometer using photographic principles his goal was to eliminate the role played by the observer in determining the brightness of an object by rendering the technique completely objective in the french physicists jean bernard léon foucault and armand hippolyte louis fizeau conducted a series of experiments for arago in which a photometer was coupled with a daguerreotype it took until for photographic plates to be systematically used in photometry it was in that year that the dutch astronomer jacobus cornelius kapteyn began to measure the brightness of stars from the southern hemisphere the technique typically used at the time to determine an object’s brightness consisted of measuring its diameter on a photographic plate the more intense the brightness the more the plate would react and the greater the diameter of the image the problem with this method is that if the light is too intense the emulsion becomes saturated and stops reacting in the american astronomer charles edward pickering found a solution to the problem of saturation he proposed to measure the amount of light passing through the object’s image on the plate rather than its diameter many improvements have been made to photographic photometers during the th century some of the most notable include the addition of an adjustable iris around a star’s image the complete automation of the procedure and the addition of a laser to increase the precision of the data astronomers « return to the instruments infrared cameras photographing the invisible using infrared light in the german astronomer william herschel was the first to discover that light is not always visible to the naked eye during an optical experiment herschel passed sunlight through a prism to separate the white light into its coloured components using a thermometer he measured the temperature of each of the coloured rays and determined that the temperature increased from blue to red pushing his experiment a little bit further herschel placed the thermometer beyond the red light rays where no light was visible to his great surprise he measured a temperature even higher than that within any of the visible rays he proved for the first time ever that invisible light – the infrared – exists beyond the red portion of the light spectrum in the scottish astronomer charles piazzi smyth detected infrared light emanating from the moon he conducted his observations at different elevations and realized that the best data had been collected at the highest elevations he was thus the first to understand that the terrestrial atmosphere absorbs some part of the infrared light coming from space unfortunately the composition of the collodion was not revealed and for the next twenty years all attempts to produce another infrared photograph failed the first publicly known infraredsensitive chemical compound dicyanine was discovered in one year later the american physicist robert williams wood recognized the possibility of improving the sensitivity of infrared photographic film using kryptocyanine emulsion the chemical cousin of dicyanine he conducted experiments and in became the first to publish photographs taken in the infrared the photos were of scenery knowing that the terrestrial atmosphere absorbs some of the infrared rays coming from space astronomers both amateurs and professionals began to collect airborne data beginning in the ’s it was during one of these expeditions that the american albert william stevens used an infrared filter in to photograph a total eclipse of the sun from an airplane at an altitude of metres in an american auguste piccard used an infrared camera to photograph the earth’s ozone layer from onboard the hot air balloon century of progressin the eastman kodak company patented the first infraredsensitive film that could produce photos using false colours telescopes borne on rockets were first used to photograph the infrared sky in the project called hi star was active until and managed to accumulate a total of minutes of observation time in all infrared sources were detected the first infrared space observatory – iras infrared astronomical satellite – was launched in and operated for months it mapped more than of the sky and discovered about infrared sources the ability of infrared light to pass through dust allowed the centre of our galaxy the milky way to be revealed for the first time a few years later in the spitzer space telescope was launched spitzer is the rollsroyce of infrared telescopes and is used to study specific astronomical targets astronomers « return to the instruments ccd cameras recording higher quality images without photographic film or plates a digital camera records images using a photosensitive cell called a chargecouple device ccd a ccd is a thin layer of silicon divided into a multitude of small squares known as picture elements usually referred to in the shortened form of pixels each pixel is separated from the next by thin insulators to take a photo the ccd is exposed to light the same principle as taking a photo using a photographic film or plate when light strikes a pixel however the silicon produces an electric charge and the greater the amount of light the greater the charge when the exposure is finished the camera’s microprocessor reads the charge on the pixels row by row and transforms the information into a digital image exposing a ccd for two minutes can therefore reveal more details than is possible during a onehour exposure using a conventional photographic plate other than photography ccds are used in photocopiers facsimile fax machines scanners and barcode readers in two researchers at bell laboratories – the americans willard boyle and george smith – designed the basic structure of a ccd and defined its operating principles several months later they developed the first video camera to function with a ccd in the american company fairchild imaging developed their first commercial ccd consisting of x pixels it was used in to produce the first astronomical photo ever taken by a digital camera it consisted of an image of the moon captured using a centimetre telescope in fairchild imaging sold the first commercial ccd camera the fairchild mv in ccd cameras made their way into professional astronomy in the use of ccd cameras became much more widespread among professional observatories for the first time ever it was possible to study celestial objects thousands of time paler than anything recorded on even the most sensitive photographic plates putting a whole new face on the universe today digital cameras are an integral part of the standard equipment in a professional observatory the largest megacam mounted on the m canadafrancehawaii telescope in uses a mosaic of ccds for a total of million pixels astronomers « return to the instruments spectrometers pulling light apart to extract information a spectrometer is an instrument that measures the properties of light over a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum there are two types of spectrometers spectroscopes and spectrographs a spectroscope transforms light into a spectrum using a prim that can be observed through a small telescope the positions of the lines reveal the chemical composition of the material in question in the italian astronomer giovanni battista donati had the idea to combine a spectroscope with his telescope he studied the spectra of fifteen stars and published his results in he was soon followed by the american astronomer lewis morris rutherfurd the italian astronomer angelo secchi and the amateur british astronomer william huggins all of whom worked independently on the sun planets moon and stars rutherfurd and secchi were the first to classify stars into groups according to their spectral characteristics in donati was the first to clearly observe the spectrum of a comet comet b that same year huggins and miller succeeded in using spectroscopy to demonstrate that nebulas are clouds of gas not stars as a result of these spectacular discoveries spectroscopes were the focus of much developmental work and were continuously improved during the ’s today they are entirely automated and controlled by a computer and the measurement of spectral lines is done using a photodetector a spectrograph operates like a spectroscope except that the small telescope is replaced by a detector that can record the spectrum of the material being studied the first spectrographs used a photographic camera as a detector it was the first photograph of our sun’s spectrum the experiment was repeated in by the american doctor and chemist john william draper in huggins and miller photographed the spectra of the sirius and capella stars using a wet collodion plate they thus obtained the first spectrogram that is the first spectral image of a star other than the sun absorption lines were not visible however and the spectrum appeared continuous it was several years later in that john william draper would be the first to record the absorption lines of a star in this case vega the world of astronomy was revolutionized and astronomers applied themselves to spectroscopy in great numbers today of our knowledge about stars has been possible thanks to spectroscopy astronomers « return to the instruments polarimeters determining the direction of light waves to better understand stars and planets in the danish physicist rasmus bartholin was the first to publish an article on the splitting of light rays by icelandic spar a very pure form of the mineral calcite calcium carbonate without knowing it he had discovered polarization – a very important property of light unfortunately without the benefit of a theory that could adequately explain the nature and behaviour of light bartholin was unable to deduce the origins of the phenomenon in the danish physicist and astronomer christiaan huygens also observed the splitting of light by icelandic spar calcite he presented an explanation in that was based on the presence of ether – a hypothetical substance that filled space – but it was quickly disputed using this theory physicists quickly understood that when a natural light source emits light it generates a myriad of waves that oscillate in planes oriented in many different directions see illustration consequently if we project light onto a screen pierced with numerous parallel slits only the light waves with the same orientation as the slits will be able to pass through only two years later in the french astronomer dominique françois jean arago invented the polariscope an instrument that can determine whether or not light is polarized among other things he discovered that lunar light is polarized the study of planet surfaces using polarimetry was significantly advanced by the french astronomer bernard ferdinand lyot working since at the meudon observatory near paris he submitted a doctoral thesis in on the polarization of light reflected from the surface of several planets among his hypotheses was the suggestion that mars experienced gigantic sandstorms – a prediction that would be confirmed by the viking probe in lyot died in but the astronomer audouincharles dollfus continued his worked at meudon dollfuss was the first to determine that the surface of mars consists of iron oxides today lyot and dollfus are considered as the pioneers of planetary polarimetry in he revealed the polarized nature of the solar spectrum emitted by the sun’s surface away from sunspots in the american astronomer horace w babcock used polarimetry to identify for the first time a star other than the sun that produces a magnetic field the star was virginis in the american astronomers john scoville hall and william albert hiltner independently discovered that of the light emitted by many stars is polarized in addition a map of polarized light across the sky revealed largescale structures of our galaxy at the time the phenomenon and pattern of widespread polarization could not be explained the answer was not long in coming however in the american astronomers jesse leonard greenstein and leverett davis jr proposed that polarization of interstellar light is due to the presence of dust particles that are naturally aligned with the magnetic field of the galaxy the two researchers even developed models that used polarimetric data to detect interstellar magnetic fields produced by individual stars today polarimeters are used to detect magnetic fields and to study the atmosphere of the sun and other stars the surface and atmosphere of planets the interstellar medium and nebulas astronomers « return to the instruments interferometers combining light rays to increase telescopic resolution in the british physicist thomas young demonstrated that light propagates as waves like waves on the surface of water for example if the crests or troughs of two light waves are coincident they combine together to create an amplified wave in what is known as constructive interference this is destructive interference between these two extremes lie an infinite number of variations in which crests and troughs combine together to intensify or dim the light in the french physicist armand hippolyte louis fizeau proposed that the resolution of telescopes could be improved if the collected light signals were allowed to combine with each other via constructive interference unfortunately the technology of the day did not permit him to construct an instrument capable of combining light waves as they emerged from a telescope during the next sixty years most studies in interferometry centred on the same type of work such as measuring the diameter of a particular star or determining the distance between the two suns in a doublestar system in the british radio astronomer martin ryle with the help of the physicist derek d vonberg constructed the first interferometer that could operate in the domain of radio waves this breakthrough allowed the two scientists to discover many new celestial objects in the british physicists and astronomers robert hanbury brown and richard quintin twiss perfected their first interferometer using separate telescopes operating in the visible light domain their instrument was tested on several types of stars and the resolution of the images were unequalled by any other imaging method in existence the sharpness of the visible details in a normal image is limited by the diffraction of light waves as they pass through the telescope’s objective during the late ’s and early ’s the arrival of more powerful computers made interferometry increasingly accessible to researchers in a group of nine canadian researchers – led by the astronomer j l allen yen of the university of toronto – jointly used the metre radio telescope of the algonquin radio observatory in ontario and the metre radio telescope of the dominion radio astrophysical observatory in british columbia to simulate a giant radio telescope measuring kilometres in diameter the distance separating the two observatories it was the first successful longdistance interferometry experiment ever conducted in under the guidance of the american physicist and future nobel laureate charles hard townes at the university columbia in new york city students michael allan johnson albert l betz and edmund charles sutton constructed the first infrared interferometer that same year the french astronomer antoine émile henry labeyrie developed the first interferometer that could operate in real time prior to labeyrie’s breakthrough radiometric data was recorded on magnetic ribbon and sent to a laboratory to be processed today images with very high resolution are obtained using interferometers local celestial objects have the greatest scientific potential and represent the best targets laminar air currents can also be blown across the surface of the mirror to minimize turbulence the earth’s atmosphere consists of layers of air at different temperatures that interact and cause largescale movements of air masses referred to as turbulence by scientists for astronomers turbulence is detrimental to their work as it disrupts the trajectory of light rays this causes stars in the sky to twinkle and telescope images to be distorted a simple means to minimize the effects of this inconvenient phenomenon is to build astronomical observatories at high elevations so that the telescopes only peer through the upper levels of the terrestrial atmosphere the first research into resolving the problem of image distortion related to atmospheric turbulence was conducted in by the german physician karl strehl who proposed a method of evaluating the image quality produced by optical systems in the soviet mathematician andrei nikolaevich kolmogorov made several breakthroughs into the study of turbulence his work would later be integrated into atmospheric models used to correct distortions affecting astronomical images in the american astronomer horace welcome babcock invented adaptive optics a process that corrects image distortions caused by the terrestrial atmosphere the technique consists of taking a sample of the light received by the telescope and calculating its degree of distortion deformable mirrors are then used to redirect the light rays and produce a corrected image the proposal was promising but babcock was not able to construct his system for technical reasons in the american physician robert b leighton of the california institute of technology succeeded in reducing atmosphereinduced image distortions using the metre telescope at the mount wilson observatory in california his technique consisted of inclining the telescope’s secondary mirror several times per second in so doing he managed to obtain the best images ever recorded of jupiter and saturn in that same year the soviet physicist vladimir pavlovich linnik published an article in which he proposed that an artificial guide star could be created by pointing a laser at the sky and targeting its focal point in the upper atmosphere to agitate gas molecules if an adaptive optics system uses a natural guide star it must be bright enough compared to the celestial object of interest to provide adequate light for the telescope’s detector the guide star and the study object must also appear sufficiently close in the sky it is not always easy to find a star that fulfills these criteria hence the idea of creating an artificial guide star in the american engineer w thomas cathey and his collaborators were the first to experimentally demonstrate an adaptive optics system that operated in real time three years later in another american engineer john w hardy built the first adaptive optics system intended for astronomy originally designed to detect soviet military satellites the system used a deformable mirror astronomers took advantage of the technique and new adaptive optics systems began to appear in the american physicist andrew buffington developed the first system to use a segmented mirror each of the six segments is controlled by a piston that could adjust the inclination in the american physicist robert q fugate and his team began to work on a system that would use a laser to generate a guide star – the idea originally proposed by linnik in the first tests were performed in and since then several adaptive optics systems have been equipped with a laser that operates on this principle in the american army been declassifying their confidential work on adaptive optics upon accessing the documents the astronomy community realized that they had already designed and constructed more powerful and less costly systems than those of the military as of observatories and large telescopes are equipped with image correction systems these systems are now considered as standard equipment for big observatories video sequence rené racine talks about

extraordinary phenomenon that illuminates our world and makes it visible what would we do without it since we first opened our eyes humans have worshipped the sun as a god of light and a source of life and security the emergence of rational thought brought with it a need to question the nature of this phenomenon so what exactly is light light is a form of energy produced by matter to understand how light is created we must first take a look at atoms the building blocks of matter in the world of atomic particles the adage holds true that opposites attract and thus the nucleus and electrons are mutually attracted to each other within the atom although an electron cannot randomly occupy positions within an atom it can nonetheless change its distance from the nucleus by changing its energy level to do this its energy content must be modified to match the energy level of the new orbit that it will enter for example to move from a distant orbit into a closer orbit the electron must eliminate some of its energy the energy released is partly electrical in nature and – as with all negatively charged bodies – partly magnetic this excess energy is released by the electron in the form of an energy packet known as a photon a photon is an energy particle that has no mass and moves at high speed when a moving photon interacts with matter it does so as a wave like a wave moving across the surface of water these waves are known as electromagnetic waves because they display both electrical and magnetic components in fact a photon can be thought of as a particle of light and an electromagnetic wave as a lightwave video sequence hubert reeves talks about light next © an original idea and a realization of the astrolab of montmégantic national park astronomers white light a mix of colours in francesco maria grimaldi an italian jesuit priest conducted a simple experiment the results of which went on to occupy the minds of several generations of physicists including newton and einstein to his great surprise grimaldi found that the beam of light illuminating the screen was larger than expected strangest of all however was that the light was no longer white but became two or three rays of different colours without knowing it grimaldi had conducted the first experiment into the splitting of light he assigned the term diffraction to the phenomenon a term that survives to this day grimaldi later realized that diffraction is a phenomenon that does not only occur when light is projected through a slit instead it occurs each time light strikes the edges of any object several scientists were interested in the effect but none could explain it the answer was not long in coming however and it was isaac newton himself who would provide the explanation in newton began his own optical experiments one of his first projects was to construct a refracting telescope he polished lenses and attempted to improve the instrument by getting rid of the coloured fringes that would appear on the margins of his images he did not succeed and decided instead to develop a mirrorbased reflecting telescope in during one of his optical experiments newton passed sunlight through a prism and split the light beam into different colours like what he observed along the edges of his optical lenses others before him had conducted similar experiments but newton was the first to understand that white light consists of a mix of light rays each with a different colour newton also understood that white light can be separated into its components because each ray of colour is deviated by the glass of the prism by a different amount he realized for example that red light is consistently less deviated than violet light this ordered separation of coloured rays is known as the spectrum the spectrum of white light consists of six basic colours arranged in a specific order red orange yellow green blue and violet although newton understood that a beam of light of a particular colour is always deviated by the same amount he did not appear to understand why this is so more than a century would pass before another british scientist by the name of thomas young would provide part of the answer next previous © an original idea and a realization of the astrolab of montmégantic national park astronomers …or the birth of spectroscopy in the physicist thomas young clearly demonstrated that light travels as a wave much like the succession of crests and troughs along the surface of water one of young’s most astonishing feats was that he succeeded in measuring the wavelengths of red and violet light that is the distance between two crests or troughs of successive waves his results revealed a wavelength of thousandths of a millimetre for red light and thousandths of a millimetre for violet combining these measurements with the basic concepts of newton’s work he concluded that light with a longer wavelength is less deflected than light with a shorter wavelength during the same historic period around the british chemist william hyde wollaston uncovered a surprising fact the spectrum of sunlight is not continuous in fact numerous black lines are superimposed on the colours of its spectrum unfortunately this revelation did not attract much attention and no ideas were advanced to explain their presence several years later in the german optician josef von fraunhofer noticed the same black lines in the spectrum of sunlight although he did not understand their significance he nonetheless measured their positions and catalogued a total of in the german chemist robert wilhelm bunsen who improved and popularized the burner that bears his name devised an original analytical technique he inserted mineral salts into the flame of his burner and observed the colours produced by the gas emitted he was thus able to determine whether a particular substance was present in a mineral by observing a colour that according to him characterized that substance gustav robert kirchhoff a german physician and friend of bunsen proposed the additional step of dispersing the light emitted by the gas by using a prism the two researchers thus made a major discovery each chemical element generates a series of spectral rays that uniquely characterize the substance much like a fingerprint identifies a person the invention of ttheir new analytical technique spectroscopy led to the discovery of many new chemical elements in the years ahead kirchhoff was interested in the spectrum of sunlight and realized that fraunhofer’s black lines corresponded exactly to the bright rays emitted by specific chemical elements he deduced that the white light produced by the hot surface of the sun was in part absorbed by certain chemical elements present in its cooler atmosphere which produces black lines in the spectrum kirchhoff’s discoveries opened the doors to spectroscopic studies in astronomy to their great satisfaction astronomers were now equipped with a method for determining the chemical composition of stars and nebulas and even their temperature distance speed and age by measuring the intensity of the different spectral rays and applying basic principles of physics it was through spectroscopy that light allowed us to touch the stars something long believed impossible due to the great distances involved one problem remained unanswered for kirchhoff he could not explain how matter could emit or absorb light other researchers would help resolve this enigma years later astronomers a map of visible and invisible light our understanding of the nature of light took a giant leap forward in the second half of the ’s with the help of the scottish physicist james clerk maxwell maxwell was interested in a multitude of scientific problems that included electricity and magnetism he first published articles on these subjects in then compiled his work in into a book entitled treatise on electricity and magnetism which is now considered a classic in the field of matter in maxwell discovered that by manipulating equations for electricity and magnetism it was possible to extract a value that corresponded to the speed of light surprised by this result he began to suspect that light electricity and magnetism were one and the same to follow up on this idea he developed new equations for electricity and magnetism and concluded that not only is light a wave – as demonstrated by thomas young more than years earlier – but an electromagnetic wave the discovery that light possesses both electric and magnetic components proved to be of paramount importance maxwell went on to reason that invisible electromagnetic waves exist beyond the visible and ultraviolet light spectra but sadly he did not live long enough to test his idea hertz labelled these new waves radio waves and their discovery was put to beneficial use in the development of the telegraph and the radio today the electromagnetic spectrum is known to extend far beyond the colours of the rainbow as shown in the diagram below the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we can see with our eyes is tiny with respect to its full extent if the electromagnetic spectrum was a window million kilometres long we would only have to open it three centimetres to let in all the visible light the electromagnetic spectrum is continuous but scientists have divided it in an artificial manner for practical reasons the divisions were mainly established by the limitations of the various techniques used to detect wavelengths for example the limits of the visible light range is defined by what our eyes can detect although other electromagnetic waves – radio waves infrared light ultraviolet light xrays and gamma rays – represent colours that are invisible to us they are nonetheless forms of light electromagnetic spectrum activity next previous © an original idea and a realization of the astrolab of

material when hot will emit light everyday examples abound the stove element in the kitchen the metal filament in a lightbulb and even the sun by the end of the ’s scientists were observing this phenomenon in their laboratories but could not explain it despite this lack of understanding they nonetheless knew how to separate the light emitted by a gas into a spectrum that was diagnostic of the chemical elements contained in the gas in the german physicist gustav robert kirchhoff called this type of spectrum an emission spectrum many researchers attempted to explain how matter could generate an emission spectrum but without success it was only in that the german physicist max planck would provide part of the answer planck noted that it was impossible to solve the problem using existing principles of physics and proceeded to develop a revolutionary theory that marked nothing less than the beginning of modern physics in his theory planck maintained that light could only be emitted as small packets of energy that he named quanta later known as photons this proposal ran contrary to all contemporary knowledge about light at that time in fact light was considered to be a continuous form of energy that propagated as an electromagnetic wave and not – as planck proposed – as a form of discontinous energy in the form of particles like photons the debate finally came to a head – and to a resolution – when the german physicist albert einstein entered the scene in einstein not only supported planck’s idea he went one step further he proposed that light behaved as a particle a photon but also retained its wave character and must therefore be considered as both a particle and a wave furthermore einstein established that the energy of a photon is related to the wavelength of the radiation he concluded that waves with long wavelengths like red light transport small amounts of energy whereas those with short wavelengths like violet light transport more energy in the danish physicist niels henrik david bohr integrated the advances of planck and einstein into his new model of the atom to explain how matter could emit light in the form of particles according to bohr the atom consists of negatively charged electrons that orbit around a positively charged nucleus the model further specified that electrons orbit the nucleus at well defined distances from the nucleus an electron orbiting near the nucleus has relatively little energy because it is held in its orbital by the strong attractive force exerted by the nucleus energy must be added to this electron for it to jump to a higher orbital and the further away it jumps the more energy it would need an electron in a starting position that is farther from the nucleus already has more energy because it must compensate for the great distance that separates it from the nucleus less energy would thus be needed to make this electron jump to a higher level compared to an electron that started closer to the nucleus according to bohr when a material is heated some of the electrons in orbitals near the nucleus will absorb enough energy to allow them to jump to new orbital levels at great distance from the nucleus the electrons however will eventually return to their original orbitals when they do so they must release enough energy so that their energy content again matches the energy level of the original orbital given the basic principle that the atomic nucleus of each chemical element has a positive charge different from that of any other element its electron orbitals must also have distinctive energy contents since the electrons must balance the charge of the nucleus the energy given off by an electron when dropping from a distant orbital to a closer orbital will thus be a photon with a characterisitc amount of energy and a corresponding wavelength in the emission spectrum if the atoms of a given element have a combination of possible orbital jumps that is different from the combinations possible for the atoms of other elements then every element will display its own unique emission spectrum the following diagram shows the emission spectra for various elements notice how the emission lines are diagnostic much like a bar code or a fingerprint emission spectra of hydrogen emission spectra of iron in astronomy this phenomenon is often observed when white light no matter what its source the surface of the sun or another star for example passes through a thin cloud of gas or dust in this case instead of seeing a continuous spectrum from red to violet astronomers will observe a spectrum in which several rays of colour are missing and dark lines take their place it was around that the british chemist william hyde wollaston noticed for the first time that the spectrum from the sun displays just this type of effect the solar spectrum is discontinuous with numerous dark lines occuring among the coloured bands at the time wollaston did not understand why this is so in the german optician josef von fraunhofer also noticed these same dark lines in the spectrum of sunlight although he also failed to understand their significance he nonetheless measured and documented the positions of lines it was only in that the german physicist gustav robert kirchhoff understood that fraunhofer’s dark lines corresponded exactly to the bright lines emitted by certain known elements according to him the dark lines represented specific chemical elements that are present within the sun’s atmosphere but are absorbing certain spectral rays emitted by the sun’s surface kirchhoff named this type of spectrum an absorption spectrum unfortunately he did not understand at the time how matter could absorb spectral rays in the italian astronomer giovanni battista donati had the idea of attaching a spectroscope to his telescope he studied the spectrum of fifteen or so stars and published his results in he was followed in by the amateur british astronomer william huggins the american astronomer lewis morris rutherfurd and the italian astronomer angelo secchi all of whom independantly worked on the sun the planets the moon and the stars these researchers began a scientific revolution by being the first to extract information from the light emitted by stars they were quickly followed by other astronomers and the study of emission spectra became the main field of study in astronomy despite considerable progress the explanation of how light could be absorbed by matter still eluded the scientists of the time the danish physicist niels henrik david bohr finally provided the answer in bohr developed a new model of the atom consisting of negatively charged electrons that occupy specific orbitals around a positive nucleus according to bohr the farther the electron orbital is positioned from the nucleus the higher its energy content in order to compensate for the great distance to the nucleus and its attractive force when a cool material is heated some of the electrons will jump from low energy orbitals near the nucleus to more distant and higher energy orbitals to do this each electron must increase its energy content to exactly match the energy level of the new orbital it will occupy bohr proposed that electrons absorb this extra energy in the form of energy packets as described by planck and einstein the same type of phenomenon occurs in space when the light emitted from the surface of a star like the sun shines through the cooler gases in the atmosphere surrounding it the atmosphere absorbs part of the white light emitted from the star which produces a colour spectrum marked by dark lines absorption lines that are characteristic of the elements present in the gas the study of a star’s spectrum thus gives us information about the chemical composition of its atmosphere astronomers the astronomer’s unit for measuring distance in astronomy distances between celestial objects – like stars and galaxies – are very large for example the distance that separates us from out closest neighbour the moon is on average kilometres the sun on the otherhand is on average million kilometres away and the next closest star is proxima centauri at billion kilometres to avoid manipulating such long numbers on a regular basis a unit of distance better adapted to the scale of the universe quickly became a necessity one unit of distance commonly used in astronomy is the lightyear a lightyear is the distance travelled by light in one year which is trillion billion million thousand and kilometres it was first necessary to determine the speed of light in order to know the distance that it will travel in one year before most scientists thought that light moved instantaneously from one point to another in that year however the danish physicist ole christensen rømer was the first to demonstrate that light had a finite speed in rømer began to observe the satellites of jupiter and decided to measure the time it took for one of the moons particularly io to disappear behind the giant planet and reappear on the other side by accumulating data for many years he determined that the time separating the eclipses was shorter when the earth was closer to jupiter and longer when it was at a greater distance in the french astronomer jeandominique cassini for whom rømer was an assistant proposed that the difference was due to the time it took light to travel from jupiter to earth however he quickly changed his mind and abandoned the hypothesis rømer on the other hand continued to pursue the idea and estimated that light takes minutes to travel a distance equal to the diameter of the earth’s orbit we know today that the true value is closer to minutes and seconds if rømer had calculated the speed of light using his data he would have come up with an answer of kilometres per second which is about half the accepted value today of kilometres per second the main source of error would have been the diameter of earth’s orbit which was not well known at the time it was only in that the majority of the astronomical community were finally convinced that light had finite speed the british astronomer james bradley published a study demonstrating that the annual variation observed in the position of the stars is related to the speed of light he estimated that light travels at kilometres per second which is very close to the accepted value in the german astronomer friedrich wilhelm bessel and not the scottish astronomer thomas henderson as is often mentioned was the first to use the lightyear as a unit of measurement in astronomy he measured the distance separating us from the binary star cygni as lightyears the advantage of the lightyear as a unit of measurement is not only that it quantifies distance but that it also provides the time it takes for light to reach earth for example if cygni is lightyears from earth kilometres then it takes it’s light years to reach us we are therefore always seeing cygni as it was more than years ago this is how light allows us to see into the past and why a telescope is really a type of time travel machine this concept applies equally to very distant galaxies that are measured at distances of to billion lightyears they appear to us now the way they existed to billion years ago only a short time after the big bang video sequencegilles

disappear… one of the negative effects of industrialization on human activity and the environment is the production of excessive light it may seem strange but excess light is a form of pollution particularly at night the negative effects of light pollution impact many fields of study including economics ecology and of course astronomy most people do not consider the surplus of artificial light as a form of pollution because it is not permanent all we must do is collectively turn out our lights to make it disappear in reality however such a solution is unrealistic because our society needs artificial light to function light pollution is mainly caused by lighting systems that are misdirected excessive inefficient or unnecessary most light pollution is found in urban settings where artificial light sources are numerous in these areas light sources may be partly directed towards the sky or downward directed light may be reflected upward light is then dispersed by layers in the atmosphere and produces a glow that diminishes the darkness of the night sky in large canadian cities more than of stars that can normally be seen with the naked eye are no longer visible unexpected negative effects from bacteria to the stars the negative effects of light pollution on human activity are numerous from an economic point of view for example the use of excessive lighting or unnecessary lighting constitutes a waste of energy that is costly to both the individual and to industries in quebec the cost of lighting the sky is estimated at million dollars per year on a larger scale excessive lighting can have an impact on global climate change if the required electricity was generated by burning fossil fuels wildlife and plants are also affected for example nighttime lighting can confuse animals that migrate like moths and migratory birds can modify predatorprey relationships and can even alter competitiveness within the same species in the case of moths for example it was discovered that numerous flowering plants declined in numbers when the flight paths of pollinating moth species were affected by light pollution it is even possible for entire ecosystems to be affected in lakes for example zooplankton may stop feeding on algae if nighttime lighting is too strong this leads to oxygen depletion in the lake and many species of invertebrates and fish then die by asphyxiation in astronomy light pollution is a real and pressing problem it diminishes the contrast between the dark sky and celestial sources of light which makes it harder to see the stars for the amateur astronomer it is a major problem because access to a truly dark sky is increasingly difficult to find the increasing inaccessibility of the starry sky is unfortunate because it has become evident that amateur astronomy plays an important role in the development of scientific interest among young people in the british government even acknowledged the link between a reduced interest in the sciences and an increase in light pollution for professional astronomers artificial light is undesirable because it interferes with the collection of data this is why new observatories are built in isolated regions a number of amateur astronomy associations are also involved in protecting our endangered legacy the starry night sky the focus of light pollution abatement programs is to change the habits of the general population companies and urban planners so that less artificial light will be wasted or misdirected the plans typically revolve around three lines of action the first consists of using lighting equipment that properly directs light where it is required and not to the sides or towards the sky the third is to use an appropriate level of lighting and

amerindians the inuit the amerindians stars were an integral part of their lives before the arrival of europeans the amerindians of canada saw the starry sky as a place full of characters and stories many of the peoples believed that everything found in nature was a living entity even celestial objects like the moon the sun and the stars in the amerindian belief system the earth is flat and the celestial objects revolve around it the planets in the solar system are not thought of as planets but rather as large stars that are simply brighter than the rest the sun and other stars are seen as lights that move across a solid celestial canopy for the majority of amerindian societies each star is a spirit – a powerful and sacred being the iroquois even oriented their long houses according to the four cardinal directions so that the sun would shine onto the entrance at dawn and set in the direction of the exit the amerindians grouped many of the stars into constellations and most of these are associated with stories that serve as a lesson to youngsters some of the constellations like pleiades or the great bear were also used to mark the seasons this is the case for one of the mi’kmaq legends of new brunswick and nova scotia one spring day mother bear woke up after hibernating through the winter being very hungry she immediately began to look for food chickadee who was also very hungry decided to hunt mother bear too little to hunt on his own he got six of his friends to help after hunting all spring and all summer the slowest and heaviest hunters beginning with the two owls flew lower and lower until they eventually lost the trail of mother bear blue jay and pigeon were the next to abandon the chase completely covered in blood he shook himself near the trees of the forest colouring them red that is why since then the leaves of the trees turn a vivid red colour in autumn as much as he tried robin was never able to remove all the blood that stained his chest and he still wears his red marks today the three friends ate mother bear and left her skeleton there during the winter the spirit of mother bear left the sky and came to rest within another sleeping bear the bear awoke the next spring and chickadee and his friends hunted her too until they killed her in autumn the story has repeated itself every year since then this legend reveals how the change in position of the great bear constellation in the sky serves to mark the beginning of autumn the amerindian societies in canada used a lunar calendar of months with days in each month amerindian legends dreamlike celestial stories the north star which remains in a fixed position in the sky was well known to amerindian peoples the following legend describes its origin according to the blackfoot of alberta two sisters sleeping outside woke before dawn and looked up at the sky one of them pointed towards the morning star venus and said that star is so beautiful i will take it as a husband several days later the same young woman came across a handsome stranger in the forest while she was carrying wood he was observing her so she asked him what do you want from me the young man replied i am morning star you wanted me as your husband so here i am he placed a feather in her hair and asked her to close her eyes he flew her up to the sky into sky country you may use this tool to harvest vegetables in our garden but you must never touch the sacred turnip if you do it will bring misfortune time passed by and the woman gave birth to a baby to her surprise she found that she could see her tribe and old home through the hole left by the turnip be careful for he must not touch the ground for days or he will return to me and become a star unfortunately what should not have happened did and the child was forced to return to the sky country but as he tried to pass through the hole left by the sacred turnip the child became stuck and that is why to this day there is a star that does not move across the sky in some cases the same celestial constellation is the subject of legends in more than one amerindian society for example two tribes in canada have stories about the constellation pleiades this one is from the iroquois of ontario many years ago an iroquois tribe began the trek toward their winter hunting grounds near a large lake in southeastern canada upon their arrival tribe members hurried to set up camp and tackle their chores eight children tired of helping their parents would gather together each day away from the tribe to dance for several hours he was covered from head to toe with a coat of shiny white feathers and said to them if you do not stop misfortune will come your way the children did not listen and continued to take longer and longer breaks during which they never stopped dancing day after day the old man came to warn them until one evening the children suddenly found themselves rising up into the air the old man shook his head and thought if only they would have listened to me not long after the people of the village saw the children floating high in the sky one of the children recognized his father’s voice and stopped dancing but quickly fell like a shooting star to the ground seven brothers living alone in the northern plains passed their time looking for their parents always on the move they were looking for food and a new shelter to sleep in tired of such a miserable life the youngest among them who was playing with a spider’s web said why not transform ourselves into something else don’t be stupid another replied rocks can be broken what about trees trees don’t break – they bend with the wind said one of the brothers even the greatest trees can be uprooted by wind and storms argued another why not take on the form of night night is never destroyed exclaimed one of the brothers night is scared of light and runs away when day arrives replied another then why not change into stars asked the wisest of the brothers they live in the sky and never die the seven brothers thought that was the best idea the youngest helped each of his brothers climb into the sky using the spider’s web he put three of them to his left and three to his right he then took his place in the middle and there they remain to this day astronomers the amerindians the inuit the inuit their knowledge of the stars helped them navigate in a hostile environment where reference points are few and far between the inuit peoples living in the canadian far north can view the dark night sky continuously for long periods of time at the north pole for example the sun rises and sets only once each year contrary to popular belief however the polar night does not last for six months each year instead it lasts for four and a half months the difference is due to the tilt of the earth which causes dawn and twilight to last for several weeks at the poles thus shortening the duration of the true polar night by six weeks each year nonetheless four and a half months is still a remarkably long night and one might think that the peoples of the arctic would have built up an extensive astronomical knowledge base this however does not appear to have been the case the time during which the northern peoples have access to the starry night sky is actually much shorter than four and a half months even for the inuit who live closest to the north pole clouds and aurora borealis also mask the stars finally the intense nighttime cold makes observation physically difficult as such the inuit have only two and a half months per year to observe the starry sky if we take into account the presence of the moon and only two months per year if we take into account the other factors all in all the peoples of the north have difficult conditions to deal with and only a short period of time for studying the stars the ancient inuit believed the earth nunarjuaq in the inuktitut language to be a flat and stationary body around which celestial objects revolved it occupied the centre of their universe the moon taqqiq was seen as a flat disk of ice and the sun siqniq as a ball of fire the disappearance of the sun below the horizon for several months was taken as a sign that the cold and frost of winter had weighed it down so much that it could no longer lift itself into the sky the planets of the solar system were seen as large stars and the distant stars as holes in the celestial dome interestingly the existence of the north star – the polar star that remains in a fixed position in the sky and around which all the other stars appear to revolve – appears to have been unknown to the peoples of the north only stars were familiar to the ancient inuit and only six or seven of them were given names among them were several that were used for navigation during their travels as for the other stars they were grouped into constellations most of which were associated with myths in which humans and animals played central roles four men were hunting a bear the bear escaped by climbing into the sky and the hunters decided to follow it as they climbed higher and higher one of the inuit lost a mitten and decided to return to earth to fetch it the other hunters continued their hunt in the sky and we can still see them today climbing after the bear in single file the inuit measure the passage of time by using the arrival of the full moon and their lunar calendar thus has months the year begins at different times for each inuit society depending on their latitude although the signal that marks the new year is the same for each tribe it is the moment when the sun reappears above the horizon after the long polar night this of course explains why the timing varies according the tribe’s northern location one such story from the inuit of the canadian central arctic tells how light first appeared on earth in the beginning darkness was everywhere there was no light on earth and it was not possible to see the ground the animals or humans strangely enough however an animal could transform into a human and a human into an animal there were several different animals like bears hares and foxes but when these animals became human they all became the same they spoke the same language lived in the same style of home and hunted the same way it was during this time that magic words were created a word mentioned casually during a conversation could suddenly acquire magical powers and nobody could explain how or why one day a fox and a hare were having an argument the fox kept repeating darkness because he liked the way he could use the dark to steal the hunting catches of the humans the hare on the other hand kept repeating daylight because he needed light to help him find food since then night and day take turns shining over earth and the fox and the hare take turns finding food as well for the inuit the sun is generally seen as a woman and the moon as a man a long time ago after the world was created a great shaman acquired such strong powers that he went to live in the sky the brother and sister lived in harmony for a long time until a great disagreement arose between them and the brother hit the sister marking her face with a disfiguring burn the young woman left her brother to take refuge elsewhere in the sky where she became the moon since then the brother and his fire have followed her trying to reach her but never succeeding the following is one example from the inuit of canada’s eastern arctic a powerful angakoq shaman decided to visit the moon at his request his hands were tied with a leather cord and the lamps in his home were extinguished the shaman then prayed to his tormaq spirit guide to transport him to the moon and the spirit complied once he arrived he realized that the moon was a house he entered and saw a beautiful woman the sun to his left who asked him to put out the lamp in front of her it is important that you do not laugh or misfortune will come your way the couple began to dance before the shaman to his great surprise he saw that the sunwoman had no back no spine and no entrails only a heart and lungs occupied her chest the dance was very strange and the faces made by the couple so peculiar that the shaman ran away lest he should laugh soon after the shaman decided to return to the house determined not to laugh once the dance had ended the moonman graciously welcomed him and invited him to visit his home in one room the shaman saw large herds of deer that roamed over vast plains in another room he saw many pods of seals swimming in the ocean the moonman let the shaman choose one of each as a gift the shaman told them his story of what he had seen on the moon the moonman is often seen as a strong and fair spirit this legend from the inuit of labrador is one such example a young orphan lived with a family that treated him badly he slept in the entrance tunnel with the dogs and ate only leftovers only the youngest of the girls in the home treated him well one night while he lay on the ground staring up at the moon he thought of ways to escape the more he stared at the moon the more convinced he became the he was staring at a human face he was so certain the face was real that he pleaded to the moonman to help him escape the moonman heard him and descended to earth he took the young orphan with him onto the beach where he flogged him with a whip with each crack of the whip across his body the boy became stronger and bigger in the morning the boy returned to the house and struck down all those who had been cruel to him with the exception of the kind young girl she became his wife and he became the leader of the village after all it is only natural for humans to wonder how far our planet lies from the moon the sun and other celestial bodies the ancients believed that this distance was not very far at all they saw the stars as being fixed upon a nearby celestial dome over the course of time however astronomers began to realize that the size of the universe is much greater than anyone had ever imagined today we know it is so big its limits remain unknown in the rd century bc the greek astronomer aristarchus of samos calculated the earth–moon and earth–sun distances using the angle between the moon and the sun at the first quarter moon his method—based on imprecise data available at the time—estimated that the distance to the sun is about times the distance to the moon although we now know that the sun is really about times the distance to the moon aristarchus’ estimate was nonetheless revolutionary because it suggested that the sun was much more distant than previously believed several decades later another greek astronomer hipparcus of nicea performed an amazing scientific feat by calculating the earth–moon distance with an error of less than he did this using the time it takes for the moon to pass through the shadow of the earth during a lunar eclipse and by applying his own ingenious geometric calculations hipparcus also relied on the work of eratosthenes of cyrene who had fairly accurately estimated the diameter of the earth to be km the real diameter is about km even more precise parallax measurements would have to wait until the development and improvement of astronomical instruments in fact it was almost two millennia later in when jeandominique cassini a french astronomer of italian origin and jean richer a french astronomer used more modern equipment to precisely measure the average earth–sun distance also known as an astronomical unit their method relied on simultaneous observations of mars from paris and french guyana the honour of being the first to measure the distance to a star other than the sun must be given to the german astronomer friedrich bessel in he calculated the distance to cygni as lightyears from earth these days astronomers have several methods for measuring distances for objects within the milky way most methods employ the method of parallax another method for measuring galactic distances uses type a supernovae stars that generate constant amounts of energy after their supernova explosion they can be thought of as a bomb standard an explosion of known strength and luminosity their apparent brightness in the sky is thus a measure of how far away they are from earth although these types of methods for measuring astronomical distances have allowed scientists to estimate the extent of the universe the sheer scale of it is mindboggling it is somewhat easier to visualize such vast distances if we begin by imagining something smaller like our own solar system the solar system consists of the sun planets that revolve around the sun and millions of smaller bodies the oort cloud a vast reservoir of comets that circle the sun marks the outer limit of the solar system the distance to this boundary is about lightyears recall that each lightyear is almost billion kilometres if you can imagine pluto—the smallest and farthest of our solar system’s planets—as the same size as the head of a pin measuring millimetre across then the sun would be as big as two centimetre beach balls lying side by side kilometres away from the head of the pin our solar system lies in the milky way spiral galaxy at this scale the size of our own solar system is quite insignificant in fact if our entire lightyear solar system could sit on the head of a pin the rest of our galaxy would be the size of a hockey rink the milky way is bunched together with more than other galaxies to form a galaxy cluster known as the local group the largest member the andromeda galaxy is visible in a moonless night sky without light pollution the other galaxies in the group like the large magellanic cloud and the small magellanic cloud are typically smaller than the milky way the local group occupies an area with a diameter of about million lightyears and a centre lying somewhere between the milky way and andromeda if you can once again imagine the solar system as a head of a pin and our galaxy as a hockey rink then the entire local group would measure kilometres across the giant virgo galaxy cluster marks the centre of the local supercluster at a distance of million lightyears the virgo cluster contains a cannibal galaxy at its centre—m—that draws in and absorbs neighbouring galaxies galaxy superclusters appear to be grouped together along long filaments that stretch out for hundreds of millions of lightyears they are separated by immense voids that contain very few galaxies the size of these virtually empty spaces is truly incredible—on the order of million lightyears this grandscale pattern defines the universe across a distance of about billion lightyears as much as we try we cannot directly observe what lies beyond that distance astronomers space time the arrangement of matter time the universe existed in a highly compressed state more than billion years ago and has been expanding ever since for a long time scientists thought that the universe was immutable—that it was unchanging over time and stars were the very essence of eternity it was only during the th century that scientists realized that this belief is false and that the cosmos changes even on human time scales in other words the universe did not always display the same structure it does today it evolved over time and thus it has a history this fascinating history began just over billion years ago with a great explosion known as the big bang the big bang theory was first presented in by the belgian astronomer and priest george henri lemaître using einstein’s theory of relativity combined with astronomical observations lemaître demonstrated that the universe is expanding although the big bang theory was not well received by einstein and his colleagues it is now widely accepted in scientific circles the turning point came in when american astronomer edwin powell hubble published a short article in which he demonstrated that galaxies are moving away from each other it was an idea that supported the expanding universe theory of lemaître another source of support for lemaître’s theory came almost years later in when an american physicist of ukrainian origin george gamow began to publish alone and then with colleagues a series of articles describing the events that took place during the first few moments after the big bang explosion according to gamow the universe was like an extremely hot energy soup that rapidly cooled enough to allow the first atomic nuclei of hydrogen and helium to form gamow’s work thus explained the longstanding mystery of why the universe contains hydrogen and helium gamow and his colleagues proposed that a glow permeated the early universe when those first atoms were created and that even today— billion years later—we should be able to detect this residual glow as radio waves from across the universe the world of astronomy was in for a remarkable revelation in when american physicists arno allan penzias and robert woodrow wilson somewhat serendipitously detected a weak radio signal coming from all directions of the cosmos at once the famous cosmic background radiation predicted by gamow penzias and wilson went on to receive the nobel prize for physics for their discovery that helped prove the big bang theory the dramatic early moments of the universe can be summed up as follows in the beginning the universe we observe today was concentrated into a single minuscule point it was only once it exploded simultaneously in all directions during a tiny fraction of a second that space was created and time began to flow our current understanding of the beginning of the universe starts millionths of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a second seconds after the big bang the universe expanded somewhat slowly at this point but its temperature was extraordinarily high at least billion billion billion degrees the cooling rate was extremely rapid however and only billionth of a second later its temperature had already dropped to billion degrees a spectacular event then occurred the size of the universe abruptly multiplied by times that’s billion trillion trillion or a followed by zeroes the universe was still extremely hot so the particles were much too agitated to combine with each other and form atoms all this would change years after the big bang when the temperature of the universe had fallen to a mere degrees at this temperature the movements of subatomic particles were sufficiently slow that the first atoms could finally form electrons—which up to this point had been spending their existence capturing and releasing photons—were now tied up with atomic nuclei protons and neutrons to create these first atoms finally freed from their struggle with the electrons photons began to move throughout space to create the earliest light energy cosmic background radiation video sequence hubert reeves explains that the universe has a history astronomers space time the arrangement of matter the arrangement of matter as the universe cooled matter became more complex after the big bang the temperature of the universe continually dropped as matter organized itself into increasingly complex forms at the grand scale the cosmos was initially filled with a homogenous gas consisting mainly of light chemical elements at long last the universe ceased to be dark as it began to fill with stars that would eventually combine to form galaxies it was in the core of these first stars and all stars since then that heavier chemical elements—like carbon oxygen silicon and iron—began to form via nuclear reactions at the end of each star’s life cycle these new chemical elements were released into space where they enriched the clouds of interstellar gas gravitational forces eventually regrouped the matter in these clouds to create a new generation of stars the life cycle of stars is responsible for adding all kinds of chemical elements to the universe under very special conditions it is even possible for atoms in the space between stars to combine with other atoms and form simple molecules or even complex molecules like amino acids some stars gain planets after being born planets can be terrestrial that is made mainly of metal and rock like the earth and mars whereas others are made mostly of gases like jupiter and saturn or ice which is probably the case for pluto the earth is a peculiar case because water can exist in liquid form thanks to this simple fact it was possible for organic molecules those consisting of carbon atoms to arrange in complex enough patterns to allow life to form although we are fairly certain that life began on earth at least billion years ago we still know very little about the conditions that allowed life to originate astronomers equipment and preparation how does a star finder work equipment and preparation astronomy is both a science and a pastime that can be practiced using only basic equipment and without being an expert the rewards of astronomy were never more accessible than they are today the recent profusion of spectacular images the explosion of knowledge and technical possibilities the ubiquitous presence of the internet and the widespread accessibility to equipment have catapulted popular astronomy into a new era astronomy can be practiced during the day or night in the daytime it is possible to observe the moon several planets and our own star the sun it is dangerous to view the sun directly instead you should project its image onto a cardboard screen using binoculars or a telescope or install special filters onto a telescope before looking through it solar spots which are dark regions on the sun’s surface are easily seen when viewing the sun using these methods bring a notebook and pencil to take notes a flashlight with a red filter will help you see your way in the dark without blinding your friends or yourself now that you are all set up familiarize yourself with the constellations using only your eyes constellations help guide us to the celestial objects we wish to observe once you have learned to orient yourself binoculars will be very helpful – even professional astronomers commonly use them mounted on a tripod binoculars provide magnificent celestial vistas revealing the topography of the moon the moons of jupiter a good number of nebulas and even some galaxies at some point you will want to add a refracting or reflecting telescope to push your observations to the next level the most important feature of a telescope is its optical precision of its optical components look for wellknown brands that have established and reliable reputations newtoniantype telescopes are generally more affordable due to their simple design at the other end of the spectrum are amateur telescopes that are as powerful as those used by professionals thanks to computers and ccd cameras in some cases the telescope can be left outside while you make your observations from inside comfortably seated in front of your computer luckily for those who do not own a telescope there are many astronomy clubs with members who share a passion for space and are more than happy to let others look through their telescopes do not hesitate to contact an astronomy club the people are invariably a very welcoming bunch how does a star finder work an indispensable sky map a star finder also known as a planisphere is a circular map with an overlay that turns to show – through an opening in the overlay – the region of the sky that is visible for a specified time date and location it is an incredibly useful tool for orienting yourself in the night sky for identifying constellations and for planning your stargazing night for southern canada a star finder designed for e north is sufficient the way a star finder works is simple the days and months of the year are shown around the edge of a circular base and the hours of the day are displayed around the overlay by turning the overlay to line up the time of your observations with the date the portion o the sky that is visible will appear through the opening in the overlay all that remains is to hold the star finder over your head and orient it with respect to north instructions the activity simulates a real star search simply click the hour you want and then drag the mouse over the circle in the middle and indicate the date and precise hour that you intend to search the sky overhead a precise representation of the sky at that precise moment may be viewed onscreen use the star searcher to pinpoint stars constellations and planets precisely then wait for a starry night to use your star searcher to locate the constellations and stars that fill our sky the astrolab thanks the national research council of canada for permission to use their electronic planisphere and to allow us to

sources aitken rg john stanley plaskett astronomers verbatim image at school narration this summer i had the most amazing vacation camping with my family i know what you’re thinking sound s boring but let me tell you more about it… sound school area image in the car narration we left the city and were driving to some unknown destination in fact i was beginning to think we were lost bubbleare we almost there bubblei’m hungry sound car image mother stop pestering your father we’re almost there… aren’t we girl why are we going to spend our vacation in the woods near a river there’s nothing to do boy yeah no stores no video games… nothing to see for miles around sound car image narration my parents had decided to bring us fishing even though they knew my brother and i didn’t want to spend our vacation in the country they told us that the decision had been during a family meeting bubblemeeting sound car image in the forest narration when we arrived at our destination we were not on a river instead we parked in a clearing in the mountains i was sure we were lost girl but there’s nothing here no friends… no music… mother you mean noise… sound countryside animals and fire image boy dad are you sure you wouldn’t rather be in a hotel in the city father i guarantee that what i am about to show you cannot be found in the city on the other hand i could think of a really long list of things that can be found in the city but not in the forest sound countryside animals and fire image narration when nighttime came my father showed us something really amazing father look boy oops bubblewow narration there were thousands of stars in the sky it was fantastic sound countryside animals and fire image boy i never realized there were so many it’s hard to believe girl do you know what that white band across the sky is father that’s the milky way our galaxy narration it was incredible there were so many more stars out there compared to in the city i’d never seen anything so beautiful narration my dad was right it was our galaxy he explained that the milky way contains at least billion stars and beyond it there are billions of other galaxies each of which contains billions more stars i’m telling you it made me dizzy just thinking about it… sound countryside animals and fire image boy i don’t understand why there are more stars here than in the city girl it’s the same sky after all mother the reason is light pollution sound countryside animals and fire image girl what’s light pollution boy it’s light that blinds us mother your brother is right light pollution is the artificial light we shine towards the sky that hides the stars it’s caused by light aimed in the wrong direction or too much light or lights that don’t even need to be on and it doesn’t just make stars disappear… it creates a bunch of other problems too narration my dad told us that in cities like montreal toronto and vancouver more than of the stars have disappeared from the sky that’s a lot there’s almost none left sound countryside animals and fire image boy you’re exaggerating… girl yeah… light isn’t like greenhouse gases we can turn off lights light isn’t permanent narration but my parents weren’t exaggerating and it’s not just disappearing stars that are the problem light pollution also has negative effects on animals plants and even our health not to mention that it’s a big waste of money and energy sound countryside animals and fire image mother even though the effects of light pollution aren’t as serious as climate change they’re still significant mother the starry sky has inspired humanity for thousands of years yet today it’s disappearing narration when my mother br said that it made me sad i realized that most kids in our country have never even seen the milky way sound countryside animals fire strange noise image narration suddenly a strange thing happened a man came out of nowhere and joined in our conversation about light pollution amerindian your parents are right girl who are you mother where did you come from amerindian i’m from around here and my name is magella sound countryside animals and fire image narration magella explained to us that the stars are our link to the universe without them mankind is like a family living in a house without windows the starry sky is our window onto the cosmos… it’s our view into that fantastic place that gave birth to the earth light pollution closes that window amerindian light pollution upsets many types of animals for example some birds fly into buildings because the lights disorient them even people are affected there are some important chemical substances inside us that our bodies can only make when it gets dark life on earth needs the night amerindian would you like a marshmallow sound school area image in the forest narration i asked magella what we can do to help his answer was a bit surprising… amerindian discussing it is enough for now you will figure out on your own how you can help girl stop talking nonsense sound countryside animals and fire image narration it was amateur astronomers coming to watch the sky astronomer good evening everyone beautiful place isn’t it he might have a telescope and computer but without his gizmos he wouldn’t even know how to find cassiopeia narration the man talking to us was the technician of the mont mégantic observatory sound countryside animals and fire image boy but his stuff is so cool technician it sure is a telescope is a very powerful piece of equipment don’t forget though… you can still admire the stars without one girl true technician yup all you need are your eyes in a place like this where the sky is really black there’s no point in using fancy equipment if you’ve lost our sense of wonder sound countryside animals and fire image boy sure but you have to admit this telescope is really cool technician you’re absolutely right telescopes have changed our view of the world looking through a telescope is like magic it shows us the universe sound countryside animals and fire image technician look up at the sky using only your eyes you can see stars planets constellations sound countryside animals and fire image technician and you can use a star finder to help you find the main stars and constellations in the sky girl neat father did you come here because this is one of the best places for stargazing technician absolutely sound countryside animals and fire image girl and there’s nothing we can do about it technician come with me… i want to show you something sound countryside animals and fire image narration the technician walked us through the woods for a few minutes boy where are we going mother i didn’t realize we were so close to the observatory boy and girl wow sound countryside animals and fire image at the observatory of the montmégantic technician i want to tell you about the program we put into place to curb light pollution father certainly but everyone must make an effort this is my best vacation ever technician play the interactive game to reduce light pollution technician now you can see through the telescope narration imagine i got to look through one of the biggest telescopes in canada there’s just one word i can think of to describe it wow the astronomer knows what he wants to see and the technician knows how to see it using the telescope girl hey it’s pretty cold here father the nights are chilly in the mountains even in summertime technician and the telescope room is never heated even in the winter if we heated it the heat would leave through the dome and blur our vision of the stars but the control room is warm that’s where we keep our screens computers and some hot chocolate to keep us awake boy wow that’s saturn narration these days astronomers don’t look through telescopes with their eyes… instead they use instruments luckily for us they had just installed an ocular the night we were there because they were getting ready for the public astronomy festival taking place the following day father it’s hard to imagine isn’t it technician in fact stars are so far away that the light they emit takes several hundred years to reach us their light carries a picture of how the stars looked several hundred years ago… it’s basically an image of the past they date back to when the universe was very young that’s why we say that telescopes are like time travel machines girl is it true that astronomers are a bit like explorers of the history of the universe technician yes that’s true by exploring the stars we have discovered that our existence here on earth is part of billion years of cosmic evolution the history of the universe is our history too… mother fascinating technician i don’t know if we are alone or not or why we are here but one thing is for certain it’s all infinitely spectacular and mysterious… never knowing the answer doesn’t really matter the most important thing is not to lose our sense of wonder image in the forest boy i can hardly wait for nighttime so we can start stargazing again mother but we’re leaving today boy and girl oh no we want to stay for the astronomy festival sound countryside and fire image father okay boy and girl yay sound countryside and fire image girl yay thanks dad boy thanks mom boy i bet i can find cassiopeia before you girl you’re on and now i’m starting up a project to help us see stars from where we live other girls cool i’ll sign it all the girls me too boy in the end i won i found cassiopeia before my sister sound school area the end © an

when the new world was discovered and canada was taking form mankind believed that the earth was the centre of the universe about the same time that québec was founded a revolutionary event was taking place in europe that would shake the very foundations of man’s view of the world the invention of the telescope ancient theories were shattered the earth was but an insignificant heavenly body in the cosmos and humanity had lost its traditional points of reference the telescope marked the end of the geocentric universe and the passage toward a universe of unconceivable dimensions since then astronomers have continued to perfect this fabulous instrument and explore aweinspiring cosmic landscapes thanks to telescopes we have discovered a new world canada was in the throes of nationhood at the same time as new astronomy was emerging and participated in its development and discoveries did you know that at one time two of the four largest telescopes in the world were in canada were you aware that our first observatories served to determine time with precision did you know that today canada is involved in some highly sophisticated projects and that canadian astronomers are renowned for being the most efficient in the world indeed few canadians are aware that between and work carried out by canadian astronomers resulted in the best citation rate in the world and what does this

overview this lesson introduces teachers and students to the resources available from the atlas of canada students will be able to analyse satellite imagery from the atlas’ printed land cover postermap and from a related interactive map on the atlas of canada web site next students will use the atlas’ interactive map of terrestrial ecozones map to collect additional information about the land cover regions at the end of the lesson students will be required to account for differences in land cover for two different locations in canada using all the information they have researched discussion questions and evaluation ideas are also provided grade level this lesson fits very well with geography and social studies curriculum for grades to in many provinces and territories it could also be modified to suit students from grades to time required • two class periods of approximately minutes each are recommended to complete the exercise parts and could be completed in the first session part in the second session part requires student access to the internet part is not accounted for in this timeline materials required access to the internet part – teachers only part – student access required land cover postermap – canada’s land cover part main objective students will use the online atlas of canada and promotional postermap to successfully interpret maps that use satellite imagery and other thematic information they will identify the dominant types of land cover in canada and will compare two different classifications using information from the interactive terrestrial ecozone map lesson sequence part teacher and student resources this section highlights the learning resources available to teachers from the atlas of canada web site to find and prepare an introductory session for students about the land cover postermap and the data used to produce it a sample note and worksheet is included part canada’s land cover using the atlas of canada postermap using the land cover postermap students work in groups to identify the types of land cover for specific locations across the country first they will use a standard atlas to identify the provinceterritory for each location on the map they will record this information in an organizer land cover and terrestrial ecozones maps using the online atlas of canada students will use interactive maps in the online atlas of canada to verify the land cover classification for each location in their organizer they will also use the terrestrial ecozones map to identify the ecozone physiography climate and soil for each location this information will be added to their organizer finally students will choose two different types of land cover from their organizer and explain the differences using information collected throughout the exercise extension evaluation ideas included in this section are discussion questions to conclude the exercise and ideas for evaluating student work teacher and student resources introduction the atlas of canada web site has many learning resources available to teachers and students for this lesson we recommend using some of the background information available online as an introduction to students before they begin working with the postermap or online maps information available to introduce the land cover postermap from the land section above access detailed information about the land cover map select read about this map beside the map title to find this information this information can also be accessed by clicking the same links on and around the map canada’s land cover using the atlas of canada postermap introduction using the land cover postermap students work in groups to identify the types of land cover for specific locations across the country they will record this information in a land cover organizer • the land cover postermap teacher note and overhead – introduction to land cover student worksheet – introduction to land cover copies of the organizers steps the teacher could also distribute a handout for students to review or preread before the exercise begins if computer access is readily available you may want students to use the web site to find this information themselves introduce students to the concept of land cover using resources from part divide the class into groups each group will be responsible for identifying the province or territory and type of land cover for specific places across canada for the purposes of this lesson we have divided the places on the map into groups with places in each group students use the land cover postermap to begin completing the organizer see sample organizers below they will use the poster map and a paper atlas to complete the first two columns of information • students use the interactive land cover map in the atlas of canada web site to verify the types of land cover and note the characteristics for each location in their organizer they will also use the interactive terrestrial ecozones map to identify the ecozone physiography climate and soil for each location materials • choose land from the popout menu that appears choose land cover map under the title land maps use the zoom in tool to find each location listed in your organizer remember this map has different types of land cover • steps for using the interactive terrestrial ecozones map select environment in the left hand menu under the title explore our maps choose ecology from the popout menu that appears choose ecological framework under the list of topics select the terrestrial ecozones map under the title ecological framework identify and record the ecozone for each place in your organizer now you need to find information about the physiography climate and soil for each location based on the ecozone to do this • select the get info from map tool above the map and then choose the ecozone in which each place is located for example vancouver is located in the pacific maritime ecozone choose get info from map then select the pacific maritime ecozone on the map a table of information will open record the information about physiography climate and soil for this ecozone discussion questions • what other factors influence the types of land cover found within different regions of canada what are the advantages and disadvantages of using an online atlas versus a paper atlas essay question why is canada’s land cover important to monitor and map project extension students choose one type of land cover and investigate the physical and human factors that affect this classification they will present their findings in a poster presentation how do we use the land landscape diversity is a product of the land’s many aspects an agrologist will look at the same area and interpret its features in terms of the processes that formed a given type of soil such as chernozem or podsol a tourist will notice the area’s overall relief a politician will view the particular land as a nation or an administrative region demographers and sociologists will study it as the backdrop of life of populated places or a setting for rural activities it is where we move live and build classifying types of land cover using satellite imagery • there are different types of land cover shown on the atlas of canada postermap the online map uses classifications and is much more specific each type of land cover can be identified by its unique spectral signature a spectral signature refers to the distinct appearance of each land cover class as seen by the satellite this means that each type of land cover reflects a specific wavelength of light and this unique signature is identified by a specific colour on the map a general colour guide to identify land cover classes is shown below colour guide • medium brownish colours portray transition treed shrubland yelloworange to reddish colours stand for broadleaf forests pink and red colours represent mixed forests light greenish yellow to beige represents cropland bluish and grey colours in the north stand for tundra purple in the south represents grassland white stands for snow and ice bright green in the north and mid latitudes represents wetland and shrubland student worksheet – introduction to land cover definition of land like a puzzle a landscape is a mosaic of countless features that mean something different to everyone canadians use measure manage and develop land how would each of the following people use the land • a geologist an agrologist a tourist a politician demographers and sociologists foresters and farmers this means that each type of land cover reflects a specific wavelength of light and this unique signature is identified by a specific colour on the map what types of land cover

lesson we recommend introducing the topic of population and population density to students before they begin working with the maps once students are familiar with the concept of population and population density they can attempt the pop quiz to assess their current knowledge of population patterns in canada introductory instructional strategies to familiarize students with three primary means of describing population total population population density and population distribution · brainstorm with students their understanding of the terms total population population density and population distribution · have the students record definitions for these terms in an organizer or in their notes · ask students to clear their desks or close their books tell them that they are about to take a pop quiz to see how much they already know about various characteristics of canada’s population decide if you want them to work individually or in pairs this could work well as a think pair share activity distribute the quiz and allow approximately minutes for completion there are no marks allocated to the quiz discuss with students their responses to the various questions of the quiz avoid correcting or providing answers to the questions as students will find the answers to the quiz in part of the lesson pop quiz – canada’s population density name complete the quiz below to see how much you know about the population of canada what is the population of canada which province is the most populated which province has the highest population density which province is the least populated which territory is the least populated what is the population of aboriginal people in canada what is the percentage of canadians who speak english as their first language what is the

a core of old massive precambrian crystalline rocks it is divided into five subregions kazan davis hudson james and laurentian regions each of these regions has its own geological characteristics the kazan region consists of vast areas of massive rocks that form flat broad sloping uplands plateaus and lowlands the general aspect of the davis regions landscape is that of a broad old erosion surface almost without surficial deposits viewed from an elevated location the landscape presents an even horizon interrupted by rounded or flattopped ranges of hills along the eastern coast the relief is generally high the hudson region forms the main central depression on the surface of the shield one of its sub regions the hudson bay lowland is a low swampy marshy plain with subdued glacial features and a belt of raised beaches that border hudson bay and james bay james region exhibits the characteristic features of the shield that are apparent in major uplands and plateaus the laurentian region comprises uplands and highlands that rise abruptly above the stlawrence lowlands along their northwestern border the borderlands regions are formed by younger rocks and surround the shield like two rings an inner ring and an outer ring the inner ring comprises a chain of lowlands plains and plateaus of generally flat lying sedimentary rocks the outer ring consists of discontinuous areas of mountains and plateaus in which the younger rocks are deformed each of these areas is divided into regions each of which comprises many smaller subdivisions that are distinctive based on their topography and geology the physiographic regions forming the borderlands include the innuitian region the arctic coastal plain the arctic lowlands the interior plains the cordilleran region the stlawrence lowlands and the appalachian region the innuitian region is characterized by two zones of mountains that are separated by extensive and discontinuous terrain of more subdued topography formed by plateaus uplands and lowlands the arctic coastal plain includes the coastal terrain along the shores of the arctic ocean from meighen island to alaska it is divided into three sections each of which has distinctive physiographic characteristics the interior plains is characterized in the southern part by semiarid prairies the central part is treecovered and the northern part is covered by tundra the cordillera is divided into three large longitudinal zones called the eastern system the interior system and the western system each system is further divided into areas and subdivided into mountains ranges plateaus hills valleys trenches basins and plains each has its own geological and physiographical characteristics the cordillera is also divided transversely into a number of segments by eastwest belts of relatively low terrain the st lawrence lowlands comprise three separate parts the west stlawrence lowland the central stlawrence lowland and the east st lawrence lowland these lowlands are plainlike areas the appalachian extends from southern quebec and gaspésie to encompass new brunswick nova scotia prince edward island and the island of newfoundland

maxima are related to their proximity to oceans which act as sources of moisture and winter storms and to the orographic effect of l the mountains in the case of western canada the two maxima are linked by a band of higher snow a l a accumulation that follows the boreal forest zone this is a preferred k track for winter storms to the north of this zone is the relatively shallow snow cover of the arctic low snowfall with extensive wind packing to the south the depth of snow is limited by the shorter accumulation season and the substantial sublimation of snow over the canadian prairies russ

readers should take note that the government of canada does not guarantee the accuracy of any of the information contained in this report nor does it necessarily endorse the organizations listed herein readers should independently verify the accuracy and reliability of the information this report is intended as a concise overview of the market for those interested in its potential and is not intended to provide indepth analysis which may be required by the individual exporter although every effort has been made to ensure that the information is correct agriculture and agrifood canada assumes no responsibility for its accuracy reliability or for any decisions arising from the information contained herein international freight forwarding in canada transporting products from the production site or from the exporters dock to the final destination is a complex undertaking using the services of an international freight forwarder has many advantages and is often recommended for agricultural exporters particularly when penetrating new or difficult markets such as developing countries international freight forwarders act on behalf of exporters in arranging transportation services the freight forwarder facilitates the international movement of goods by providing a wide range of advisory administrative and physical services to the exporter international freight forwarders are multimodal transportation specialists and are well placed to select the transportation method best suited for the type of product and the final destination at the lowest cost most freight forwarders handle land ocean and air transportation but usually have separate departments the freight forwarding industry in canada consists of roughly companies which employ about employees they have offices in more than locations across the country although offices are mainly found in montreal toronto and vancouver most international freight forwarders in canada are members of the canadian international freight forwarders association ciffa a well respected professional association see ciffa’s website at wwwciffacom ciffa is a member of the international federation of freight forwarders associations fiata when selecting a freight forwarder an exporter should verify that the company in question is a member of ciffa members are required to carry minimum liability insurance coverage and must adhere to standard trading practices and responsibilities for freight forwarders functions of the international freight forwarder according to the ciffa the most elementary role of the international freight forwarder is to arrange for the movement of goods from point a to point b in accordance with the clients instructions in the most economical timely and safe fashion the ten major functions a forwarder can perform are freight forwarders can recommend the best economicaltimelysafe routing and book space with a carrier thanks to more efficient routing an exporters goods may be more competitive in new markets packaging they advise on or arrange for appropriate packaging marking and labelling or containerization this includes directions on stowing and container use customs clearance freight forwarders need a basic knowledge of how local and foreign customs clearance works and what papers are required for it they give advice on foreign import regulations transport insurance unless the exporters make their own insurance arrangements the forwarders are usually asked to do so because of their knowledge of the available coverage and their limitations warehousing and distribution freight forwarders arrange storage either after customs clearance or while still in bond and give advice on facilities rates and procedures they also arrange for the distribution of large lots including relabelling and reshipping rate and contract negotiations forwarders command a large volume of freight and are thus in a position of strength to obtain the best possible rates finding alternatives forwarders are flexible and can find alternative ways of moving the goods in the case of an emergency such as earthquakes strikes weather or riots groupageconsolidation smaller shipments may be moved into a full carloadtrailer loadcontainer load at great savings to the exporter a worldwide network with branches or correspondents in all major portscities they act as groupage or degroupage agents attend to reforwarding and customs clearance and are available for advice and consultation followup forwarders stay in touch with their customers and see to it that their shipments once delivered to the carrier do indeed move out and reach their destination furthermore freight forwarders can provide the exporter with an initial quotation on the following • cost of freight • port charges • consular fees • cost of special documentation • cost of insurance advantages to freight forwarding freight forwarders are able to offer transportation consolidation services that are often cheaper than those the exporter could arrange directly with the transportation company if the exporter has insufficient volumes to fill a rail car ocean container or highway truck the freight forwarder can consolidate the shipment with other small shipments into a larger more economical load the final cost of a full load is less for everybody involved at the destination the freight forwarder or agent will unload and deliver the deconsolidated shipment to its destination in the target country similar savings may be attained when freight forwarders negotiate volume discounts for clients or by using the freightallkinds fak rate system in this case one rate is charged although different commodities are combined in a shipment for small firms it may be more efficient to use the services of an experienced international freight forwarder than to develop an inhouse transportation management unit selecting a freight forwarder when selecting a freight forwarder the exporter may find recommendations from other exporting firms and trade specialists useful likewise trade associations may be helpful and facilitate the selection process if you are exporting for the first time it is wise to speak with several freight forwarders before deciding which one to use the companys references and relevant experience in the destination country should be considered the following criteria should also be considered is the freight forwarder a member of ciffa is the freight forwarder a member of the international air transport association iata although iata membership is not mandatory when dealing with international air cargo freight forwarders registered with iata must meet criteria regarding financial and credit standing physical facilities professional qualifications and ethical practice does the freight forwarder have a good credit rating check with carriers to see that the freight forwarder has a good payment record review a copy of their annual report does the freight forwarder have a record of customer satisfaction ask for a list of satisfied customers and contact them does the freight forwarder have knowledge of and experience with your product desired shipment method carriers and destination country does the freight forwarder have a network of overseas agents and an office near the shipping port and in the destination country is the freight forwarder large enough to handle your business do they have sufficient staff to handle your shipment do they have warehousing facilities if needed does the freight forwarder carry errors and omissions insurance does the freight forwarder have favourable shipping rates and schedules what services are provided free of charge does the freight forwarder offer a complete package of services freight forwarding brokerage packaging etc does the freight forwarder have electronic communications and electronic data interchange edi capability does the freight forwarder have time to answer your questions contracts the following contract elements should be discussed by the exporter and freight forwarder prior to finalizing a contract a list of the transportation phases that are the responsibility of the freight forwarder contract dates the date on which the freight forwarder will take charge of the product the delivery date a precise description of the delivery address and the names of the contact persons all the required export documentation details of what constitutes proof of delivery to the consignee at the agreed point of delivery or transfer of ownership insurance claim file contract conditions should be in accordance with incoterms when deciding to use the services of a freight forwarder the exporter should provide the freight forwarder with a shippers letter of instructions in addition to all other pertinent documents this letter will ensure that the forwarder is made aware of any special handling requirements and other administrative needs other considerations at times a freight forwarder may be hired just to arrange for a product to be transported this service is provided for a fee that will include the services as well as the cost of transporting the goods the exporter will normally factor in these costs when arriving at the price charged to the foreign buyer sometimes freight forwarders specialize in one of two main transportation modes such as sea or air or have experience with one particular country some freight forwarders have extensive networks that will prove more effective that others only a limited number of freight forwarders truly specialize in the transportation of goods to developing countries sometimes the forwarder will act as a broker for the carrier and will be paid a commission when acting as the carrier in contracts with exporters

july forward this information piece is provided to update the statistical information of existing documents on algeria due to recent economic developments an update was deemed necessary the government is currently focusing its attention on economic modernization and international relations with specific goals of reducing unemployment and diversifying a petroleumbased economy in the algerian government launched an economic recovery platform that supported a drive towards economic growth and stability the us billion dollar program focused on revitalizing agricultural production stepping up public water improving transport and infrastructure improving living standards and promoting local development additional reforms seek to integrate algeria into the world economy freeing the country from it’s dependence on the hydrocarbon industry and enabling private enterprise to access the energy and mining opportunities within the country the path towards liberalization of the economy has already shown positive impacts in economic reforms as well as reforms to investment regulations attracted us billion of foreign direct investment fdi the second largest destination for fdi in the african continent current situation the algerian economy has grown steadily in the last few years with growth rates of in and in this growth is a result of strong performance in the oil and gas industry and regular increases in hydrocarbon and agrifood production despite drawing in a lot of revenue for the economy the oil sector does not contribute positively to the unemployment problem this has resulted in algeria placing great emphasis on decreasing large scale unemployment estimated at in this number may reach as high as for the under s age group with of the population under the age of the government has recognized the need for decisive action to alter the countries employment numbers the government generally relies on the army to maintain stability but with the recent reelection of the first non military president abdelaziz bouteflika with of the popular vote stability is expected to be maintained via other methods over the next two year period this non military leadership supported by a majority of the population indicates that militants are a politically depleted force however this stand against islamist insurgency has not completely hindered their efforts as they have since launched daring attacks on security forces there will be little pressure from a financial angle for reform since the algerian government projects record hydrocarbon sales in past reforms were required due to strong levels of expenditure and weaker earnings from oil and gas output real gdp growth is expected to remain high at in due to oil and gas industry output with gdp growth rate projections extending into at overall export earnings are predicted to reach us billion in a direct result of record high oil prices this will send the account surplus up to us billion or of gdp the surplus is expected to lessen in as oil prices level off but will still remain significant at nearly of gdp algeria has accumulated a cushion of deposits in the central bank substantial enough to cover budgetary and balance of payments financing needs for over two years following any kind of downturn in oil prices consumer market it is difficult to assess the potential for western consumer goods in algeria as the algerian consumer market has not yet been exposed to western style marketing techniques as the number of working women increases the demand for readymade processed products is also increasing traditional cooking habits are not forgotten but variations on diets and food preparation are slowly being adopted as a traditional society algerians require traditional methods of product exposure while consumers are more familiar with seeing imported products the combination of low incomes and high consumer prices for these goods has made success difficult a positive for the import sector can be seen through the rise in private importers since the economic liberalization that took place in algeria key algerian exports are dates wine and potatoes agricultural success is dependent on rainfall and therefore the sector can often suffer in times of drought the agriculture sector is growing in importance and size in algeria the algerian government is seeking to advance the sector through improved agricultural production techniques a move designed to lessen their dependence on imports mutton and lamb dominate algerian consumption closely followed by beef veal horse and rabbit are also eaten but in small quantities pork is not marketed in algeria as it is prohibited by islam algerian’s are also extensive milk consumers their needs are estimated at billion liters a year two thirds of which is imported population main cities algiers oran constantine annaba million while this market is difficult opportunities exist within the local food processing industry to provide raw and semi processed goods the number of food processors is growing and they are demanding quality raw materials key processing sectors are dairy and milling many processors prefer to import directly as opposed to buying from a local importer canadian exporters can play a role in directly supplying these processors similarly the tourist niche also exists canadian exporters of consumeroriented products algeria country profile statistical overview this ongoing process will call for technical assistance and farm equipment not available in algeria these are prospects that would benefit from canadian involvement and expertise within agriculture the cereals sector is greatly affected by problems with efficiency and outdated technology durum wheat takes up of the country’s agricultural production area followed by soft wheat at however government programs have already begun to influence its performance harvests of durum wheat wheat barley and oats all increased despite the great seasonal results cereal imports were required to supplement approximately one third of national cereal requirements trade algeria reported a trade surplus of us billion in exports totaled us billion up over from while imports increased by over to us billion hydrocarbons continued to lead exports at us billion an increase of over totals petroleum natural gas and petroleum products dominate algeria’s exports at of the whole market trade agreements algeria has established a number of trade agreements which are growing in strength most important of these is the arab maghreb union nations party to this agreement include algeria tunisia morocco libya and mauritania bilateral investment agreements are in place between algeria and france italy belgium and spain algeria has maintained lasting ties with france market access recent government initiatives in all areas of business are attempting to facilitate easy access to the algerian market the move is part of an effort to bring foreign trade regulations into conformity with wto standards with these standards comes the requirement of import licensing a licensing regime was intended to be canadian market access efforts in resulted in the canadian food inspection agency negotiating a certificate for the export of dairy products and bovine semen this year canada hopes to negotiate a certificate for live cattle algerian organizations tend to deal only with foreign partners who have managed to gain their confidence through personal visits careful follow up and the ability to honor commitments it is often necessary to have previous international experience and to spend large amounts on market development but the contracts are substantial in terms of length algeria provides great incentive to invest within the country companies established in algeria that export of production are exempt from taxes and companies exporting of production are exempt from of taxes offerings of reduced customs duties reduction in social security contributions for algerian employers from to a threeyear exemption from the value added tax on goods and services acquired locally or imported and exemption on property taxes are all in place to attract fdi this attraction has been successful with algeria second only to south africa in fdi generation on the african continent canada algeria trade and investment algerians take a favourable view of canada’s international policies including those toward the developing world there is a mutual desire between the two governments to intensify canada also provides financial assistance through open lines of credit the canadian international development agency cida provides financial assistance and counseling to canadian firms seeking to initiate business activity in algeria algeria holds the second position in africa and the middle east for level of contributions under the program a strong indication of bilateral interest and support country

august forward this information piece is provided to update the statistical information of existing documents on iran due to recent economic developments an update was deemed necessary economy iran’s economic structure is comprised of state owned large enterprises small scale village agriculture and private trading and service business enterprises iran’s large and fast growing population coupled with their hold on the world’s fourth largest oil reserve make iran a significant economy oil sales account for over one third of the governments total income natural resources and key sectors within iran’s economy as well as areas for opportunity are oil roughly of world’s oil gas of world’s gas agriculture mining and minerals petrochemicals output of million ons per year one sixth of country’s non oil exports information technology environment and electric power economic indicators reveal that economic growth cannot keep pace with labor force growth and advancing unemployment rates that are set at but unofficial estimates reach as high as economic growth is a high priority but one that has proceeded at a reserved pace current situation iran’s current situation is highly reflective of two decades of revolution war and economic struggle with most economic activity controlled by an often inefficient state sector changes in economic structure are solely dependent on the state taking considerable action the new five year plan is a step towards a more on one hand iran is comprised of a young and economically active population a demographic shift has resulted in nearly of the population in the under age category and of the population is under demographics total population growth rate age breakdown yrs yrs yrs and over life expectancy total male female million yrs yrs yrs forecast iran’s current president will likely be unable to advance liberalizing policies before his final term is up in mid due to many powerful institutions being run by conservative minorities recent parliamentary elections have lead to a conservative majority which will likely to lead to more reliability in government and a likeliness for coherent policy making the incoming parliament will stand behind their campaign and work towards improved living standards gdp is anticipated to remain close to standards in at about while the average rate of inflation is forecasted to fall from a rate of to in decreasing further to in this is a refreshing downward trend but inflationary pressures are expected to remain iran’s population is increasing urbanized with of the population living in larger cities despite perceptions only of iran’s total land mass is made up is desert the remaining area is made up of natural range land forest and roughly arable land the major constraint to further development of the agricultural sector is not the availability of land rather the availability of water only of the country receives adequate rainfall for agriculture irrigating techniques are heavily relied upon to battle limited water supply much of the arable land is used to grow wheat and barley manmade irrigation systems are used in certain areas while rainfed and dry farming methods are used in western and northwestern iran iran has become more or less selfsufficient in the production of certain fruits vegetables and livestock a demand for western products and services does exist and is an increasing trend in the consumer market it is deficient marketing market research and unreliable distribution methods that are slowing an otherwise forward moving trend brand recognition and advertising will continue to be a problem for imported products in iran as a number of forms of advertising are banned in the country also the government is very firm on what products can and cannot be sold to their citizens therefore putting solid restrictions on import opportunities while efforts to modernize the retail sector in iran have provided the country with more modern stores the urban bazaar has historically been the heart of the iranian town in most areas the bazaar is centrally located and covers a large area with small shops grouped by service or product an ideal environment for iranian’s to practice their widely used bargaining skills other opportunities for canadian companies include trade in livestock genetics including breeding stock semen and embryos also there exists a demand for new healthful foods nutraceuticals and halal meat there is also a demand for agricultural expertise and consulting management for technology and equipment for food processing packing and quality control subsistence agriculture and achieve modernization these include dam building subsidization of irrigation and more governmental transparency the key issue is how rapidly the country should open itself to the modernizing influences of the outside world the governments last year development plan helped liberalize production and marketing in the sector allocated foreign exchange at a preferential rate for the import of agricultural machinery and continued to pay subsidies on domestic production this plan expires in but similar priorities are expected to extend into the future the ministry of agriculture has been urging peasants to consolidate their small scattered farming plots and to form rural production cooperatives rpcs optimally each rpc will cover to hectares of land and employ to farmers who will maintain their individual ownership while the movement towards rpcs has been slow it is estimated that by almost all of irans farms will consist of rpcs or large commercial farms despite the importance placed on agriculture problems plaguing the sector’s development remain including shortages of water inefficient irrigation outdated farm machinery lack of raw materials and the common practice of subsistence farming the government heavily subsidizes delivered water for irrigation but suspects that high subsidization of the cost of water is a deterrent to its efficient use as a result only about of cultivated land is equipped with full or partial control irrigation by far the largest proportion of irrigated land is for wheat exports totaled us billion while imports were valued at us billion both exports and imports increased from and are likely to continue an upward trend for trade totals oil and gas industry output accounted for of iran’s total exports in other top exportable commodities in iran are chemical and petrochemical products fruits and nuts and carpets leading suppliers to iran are germany at italy at france at china at and south korea at trade agreements iran’s islamic foreign policy emphasizes support for muslims globally as well as increasing diplomatic contacts with developing countries syria continues to be a significant trade ally to iran iran maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with russia and other former soviet states both iran and russia agree that their national interest is best served if more development occurred in central asia country profile statistical overview this is as a result of deliberate government planning however the government does wish to establish outside relations in a continuous effort to modernize the country many opportunities for trade exist in iran but interested companies must accept a higher level of risk than would be evident in other countries import barriers in iran enforce islamic law and prohibit numerous commodities including alcohol and pork iran’s import rules and regulations are complex and everchanging each year the iranian ministry of commerce publishes a new handbook on export and import guidelines all imports must be registered with the ministry of commerce from which a general importing license is obtained also in the majority of cases the importer must have the approval of the relevant ministry for their commodity in order for an iranian company to be granted the opportunity to import the product imported must be classified as one of strategic importance eg wheat edible oil or specific technology in the past iranian government has banned or heavily restricted through high tariffs the importation of agricultural products that are produced in iran in cases where the country’s production cannot meet domestic demand such products can be imported into the country with the proper ministry of commerce and agricultural jihad approval despite recent improvements and ongoing efforts to improve canadian access to the iranian market nearly of the economy is stateowned making the client the government procurement policies and complexities can lengthen the trade process considerably as privatization slowly proceeds and canadianiranian efforts to facilitate business continue such barriers will likely dissipate for the time being the government trading corporation of iran gtc is affiliated to the ministry of commerce and imports essential commodities such as wheat sugar rice crude vegetable oil fertilizers frozen chicken and baby milk powder these commodities are delivered to the recipient organizations and they in turn distribute the commodities inside the country this is an internal trade agreement between the iranian government and the gtc relations are common with diplomatic relations commencing in ending from and reinstated in to present date exchanges will continue in efforts to solidify cultural bilateral and commercial bonds iranian business people are very keen to find canadian suppliers for commodities livestock feed and certain types of technology and equipment although there is limited potential for canadian valueadded agrifood products at present it is not due to a lack of market demand but more to import restrictions and local processing capabilities while many trade opportunities exist in other sectors at present canadian agriculture and agrifood exports are centered around bulk commodities this sector provides the most vast opportunity for canadian exporters in all it appears iran’s weaknesses are canadian strengths creating a highlybeneficial trade opportunity for canadian companies in canadian exports to iran amounted to million up nearly from while iran’s exports to canada amounted to million up from a year earlier iran ranks th as an export market for canadian goods and th as a source of imports into canada imports from iran were dominated by carpet and rug mill output accounting for of the total market or million noncitrus fruit and tree nut farming output represented of canadian imports from iran fruit and vegetable canning pickling and drying represented of the import market while aerospace products and parts represented the increase in canadian imports from iran was in most part due to the doubling of the noncitrus fruit and tree nut market soybean exports represented of canadian exports to iran while material handling equipment accounted for of exports and mining and oil and gas as well as navigational measuring and medicinal equipment each accounted for of the market the increase in canadian exports to iran is partly explained through the million dollar increase in the wheat export market as well as the million dollar increase in material handling machinery exports canada’s exports were valued at million and imports from iran were valued at million resulting in a positive trade balance of million wheat dominated exports accounting for or million of canada’s agricultural exports to iran this commodity has always been a top export to iran but amounts can fluctuate form the million exported in to the million in wheat imports are closely guided by government these imports are of strategic importance to the country to meet domestic needs but government closely protects the

integrated manufacturing capabilities thriving agricultural sector attractive tourism industry and skilled labour force the country is also home to an expanding middleaged consumer group and dominant young population that are the driving forces behind the country’s demand for more north americantype packaged processed and convenience foods as well as fast food outlets coupled with a rising standard of living and greater disposable incomes this millionstrong consumer group may become an extremely lucrative target market for canadian agrifood exporters in the future canadaegypt relations canada and egypt have maintained a positive bilateral relationship since the countries first established diplomatic relations in the countries currently share trade development educational and

imports included ice cream and unsweetened milk and cream powder worth over and or roughly and of total imports respectively economy major economic and political reforms have transformed egypt into a more privatized economy over the past years historically growth has been driven by public sector spending and exports while domestic consumption and investment showed slower increases to accelerate growth the egyptian government recently introduced an economic liberalization program reductions in personal and corporate income tax rates to and energy subsidies as well as the privatization of several enterprises were implemented between and such reforms are expected to result in strong future economic growth that will raise the standard of living and in turn encourage consumption and investment however egypt’s fiscal deficit and inflation rate are being stretched as a result of such efforts the egyptian government has identified foreign investment as a critical component to sustained economic growth as a result investors are given special exemptions and incentives such as the right to send home capital own foreign currency accounts and receive equal treatment however several barriers to investment remain including a high level of bureaucracy complex tax systems and customs procedures the prohibition of foreigners owning agricultural land in certain regions and the role of commercial agent and importer or trader being limited to egyptian nationals to offset these obstacles the egyptian customs authority is currently addressing its procedures and aims to introduce a preclearance system and simplified inspection process while the state plans to increase privatization and fiscal transparency and improve tax regulations gross domestic product gdp gdp growth gdp capita gdp capita ppp us billion us us current economic trends • gdp reached a value of us billion in and is forecast to reach over us billion in • the central bank has implemented a more consistent monetary management system that has resulted in better control over the inflation rate and helped to strengthen the egyptian pound against the united states’ dollar forecasted economic trends • gdp growth is forecast to slow to in and further decrease to and in and respectively • egypt’s future economic expansion is forecast to result in steady employment growth reducing the unemployment rate from its level of egypt country report consumers at all income levels are willing to spend a large portion of their income on food as eating is an integral part of egyptian culture typically middle and upperincome families spend times more on food and beverages than lower income families food and nonalcoholic beverage expenditure represents the largest consumer expenditure category in egypt making up roughly of total expenditure in total consumer expenditure in egypt was roughly million in this value has increased by since egyptians typically eat three meals a day with lunch being the largest most important meal traditional egyptian meals include vegetables and rice or pasta meat is also included depending on affordability however in recent years there has been an increasing interest in north american and european food and beverage products snack food consumption in particular sweets salty foods and carbonated beverages has shifted away from traditional egyptian snack foods egyptian consumers are not typically concerned with healthy eating however higherincome groups have generally higher levels of awareness about healthy eating and may choose products with lower fat and cholesterol expansion of fast food chains and hotels and resorts has increased potential for imported goods to enter egypt’s foodservice market in recent years the fast food market is growing tremendously in egypt with about north american chains currently located in the country aw chili’s kfc mcdonalds hard rock café little caesars pizza hut and tgi fridays are some examples of north american chains dominating egypt’s fast food market egypt’s successful and growing tourism industry is also becoming more accommodating of imported food products as tourists are more aware of international food trends this industry is seeing large expansion in areas such as cairo the red coast and sinai there are currently about hotels in sharm el sheikh red sea resort and this number is expected to increase as the government continues to support investment in hotels and tourist resorts more affluent households and single people may eat out at least once a week • egypt has a young population with over of egyptians under the age of in the median age was young adults in the older range especially those from affluent backgrounds represent a lucrative consumer market for exporters as this group spends much of their income on entertainment travelling and dining at restaurants between and this group will increase in size by more than middleaged adults commonly have children and are consumed by increasingly busy lifestyles population densityregions • of egypt’s population inhabits of the country’s landmass and are mostly located along the nile and the nile delta of the population lives in cairo with alexandria and mansoura following as the next largest cities in egypt retail food market • there are a growing number of supermarket chains and hypermarkets in egypt which are driving consumer demand for newtomarket food and beverage products egypt’s production of beverages ie mineral and bottled water soft drinks tea coffee and alcoholic drinks are dependant on substantial fruit and vegetable supplies popular and growing products the consumption of bottled water increased by about between and this is mostly due to the increasing awareness of poor tap water quality in egypt most consumers from middle and upperincome segments are more drawn to using bottled water at home instead of tap water of soft drinks consumed by egyptians are carbonated the consumption of carbonated beverages increased by more than between and this growth was mainly due to the rising price of red meat in the egyptian market and the growing variety of fresh fish available to consumers processed cheese although all dried and processed foods have seen increases in the egyptian food market processed cheese has had the most success from to the sale of processed cheese increased by almost in comparison canadian food exports only account for of egypt’s imported food market furthermore the united states and many european countries specifically france germany spain and italy and south africa are egypt’s top suppliers of consumerready food products egypt’s trade agreements with various neighbouring countries the united states and europe also act as major challenges to canada’s success in the egyptian food market egypt has a strong trade relationship with the european union eu in egypt signed and an agreement with the eu effectively lifting barriers to nonagricultural trade to europe egypt has also joined the qualified industrial zones qiz by signing a trilateral agreement with the united states and israel this agreement is seen as a step toward the signing of a free trade agreement between egypt and the united states in the future the egyptian government also frequently applies reference prices and high tariffs on certain products such as apples and alcoholic beverages although egypt has significantly reduced import tariffs duties on some products are still very high for example most customeroriented product tariffs are while some fruit eg apples and pears still have relatively high rates of the egyptian government is working to increase business activity by attracting foreign investment in doing so the government is introducing reforms on economic legal and monetary policies and has introduced incentives and provided additional opportunities for international and bilateral trade free trade zones have also been established in many egyptian cities this has created excellent environments for businesses growth in egypt’s large urban areas such changes have since provided significant opportunities to foreign companies in accessing the egyptian market the country’s eight main seaports handle approximately million tons of goods per year improvements to egypt’s highways are underway and

httpwwwfasusdagovscriptswattacherepdefaultasp doing business in egypt market informationmiddle east and north africa agriculture sector market brief iran january agriculture iran is currently one of the worlds largest net importers of agricultural products importing of its food requirements the countrys rapid population growth and an increase in disposable income are expected to substantially raise the demand for food over the medium and longterm and should lead to diversification in agricultural imports in the iranian year ended march the countrys agricultural sector accounted for of the gnp of job creation of nonoil exports of domestically needed foodstuffs and of the raw materials used in food processing plants agriculture effectively constitutes the backbone of iranian production and some million hectares of land are under cultivation throughout the country the ministry of agricultural jihads statistics show that annual production in iran between march and march exceeded million tons in addition to being the largest producer of saffron and pistachios in the world iran is also among the top ten producers of ten other potentially exportable items geographically iran is located between ° n latitude and has a total area of km of which km suitable for agriculture the climatic conditions in much of iran are typical of arid and semiarid regions while the caspian coast is considered subtropical nevertheless the country has a wide spectrum of climatic physiographic and hydrological conditions however much of the arable land is devoted to growing wheat and barley which are staple food and the main sources of protein for the average iranian wheat alone covers about while various fruits account for of the total irrigated land in iran estimate two farming systems manmade irrigation and rainfed dry farming are primarily used in different parts of the country and the area devoted to each system varies considerably depending on agroclimatic conditions rainfed and dry farming are most successful in western and northwestern iran as well as the lowlands along the caspian coast in other parts of the country dry farming is also practiced in hilly areas but the yields are limited in the central plateau as well as the southern plains and the southern coastal areas of iran crop production is mostly possible only with irrigation due to low rainfall and high evaporation rates in some lowlying plains in the central plateau the annual rainfall is about mm while the annual evaporation may exceed mm the countrywide average precipitation is about mm a year the table below shows the area of land under cultivation crop year land under annual cops hectares of this about million hectares is cultivated irrigated and rainfed while nearly million hectares is left fallow every year an estimated million hectares of unused land are potentially suitable for crop production but a shortage of water resources limits their agricultural role it is important to take into account that more than half of the country consists of rangeland generally of low to medium productivity wasteland and mountains sand dunes salt flats and other nonproductive land found mostly in the central plateau and the southern coastal areas comprise million hectares the main crops produced by iranian farmers are grains such as wheat rice and barley due to special programs initiated in the agricultural sector iran has become more or less selfsufficient in the production of several farm products including certain fruits vegetables and livestock nevertheless iran remains a net importer of foodstuffs due in part to the drought that has affected the country for the last few years the following tables indicate the major sources of irans agricultural products and the total import values main sources of iranian agricultural imports product source country oil argentina brazil canada uae oil seeds canada brazil uae netherlands pulses canada pakistan iraq uae other agricultural products wheat barley corn etc canada australia kazakhstan thailand argentina the major importer of wheat is the government trading company gtc which has traditionally worked with the gtcs of exporting countries however recently enacted regulations have allowed for private companies import of raw wheat as long as it is processed in iran and then reexported with the firm profiting from the added value of the processed product wheat production like other agricultural activities currently benefits from large state subsidies and although the government is planning to reduce their assistance wheat will be the last to be affected as it is the staple grain in the diets of most iranians since the record crop of million tons of barley in acreage and production have been steadily decreasing and imports have increased while canada has sold quantities of barley to iran in the past annual exports have not exceeded tons since for the fiscal year domestic barley production decreased to million tons and the following year iran imported million tons worth us million canadas share of the total barley import during the latter period was tons corn has been gaining significance in its use as a feed grain since as very little corn is produced domestically imports have increased at the same pace as feed use during some million tons worth us million were imported and canadas share of the total was million tons while iranians consume over million tons of edible oils annually they produce only about tons therefore requiring a large amount of imports soybean imports are also of significant quantities and the demand for canola seeds and oil is ever growing the estimated million tons of imports come in the form of seeds as opposed to oils since the governments third year economic development plan states that in order to support domestic employment and to economize on foreign exchange reserves oil seeds or oil cake should be imported instead of processed edible oils the various forms of edible oil imported by iran and the main sources are as follows • soya oil raw • peanut oil refined • olive oil • palm oil raw • sunflower oil raw and refined • cotton seed oil raw and refined • coconut oil raw and refined • date seed oil raw and refined • linseed oil raw and refined • animal oils rice rice is an important part of the iranian diet and in it was the fourth largest crop grown in the country in terms of volume while production has been steadily increasing from year to year production in experienced a slight decrease due to the drought while iran produces dry beans chickpeas lentils and millet though imports are required when production is not sufficient the countrys pulse market amounts to metric tons per year valued at approximately us million the annual production of various crops in iran is indicated in the table below source country wheat barley although traditionally migratory tribes have maintained large herds of sheep and goats and small farms have produced both meat and milk the higher demand for meat has prompted a move toward the widespread establishment of largescale industrial farms domestic production of meat lamb chicken beef and goat totals almost million tons annually which is all but sufficient to meet internal demand however some imports of various types of meat excluding pork are allowed in order to maintain price stability in addition with the continued expansion of industrial farming both for dairy and meat production the need for genetic materials has also increased significantly the following points indicate irans potential for attracting foreign involvement • there are several largescale stateowned agricultural enterprises that can be offered to the local or foreign private sector • export opportunities available to foreign companies investors are enhanced by irans geographic location and the fact that agriculture in the surrounding regions persian gulf states caucasus and central asian republics has not traditionally flourished • imports of seeds pesticides and agricultural machinery help create foreign investment opportunities • an everincreasing need to upgrade technical knowledge improve quality and increase productivity set the stage for foreign involvement • there are excellent opportunities for foreign companies in irans agriculture sector including the establishment of irrigation and forestation systems • in the past two decades the iranian government has put emphasis on supporting the industry and is determined to continue to do so in the future foreign companies by forming joint ventures with iranian entities can also benefit from other services such as bank loan privileges and export tax exemptions bank services related to agriculture are usually rendered through bank keshavarzi the interest this bank charges is the lowest when compared to the rates charged to the countrys other economic activities such as construction industry and services the third year economic development plan specifies that the government should allocate of bank loans provided for irans development to the water and agriculture sectors foreign manufacturers of agricultural equipment and machinery can export their products to iran or in partnership with iranian firms can produce or assemble their products within the country imports are not generally encouraged by the iranian government and can be subject to high taxes tariffs and charges in addition in order to realize maximum growth a point stipulated by the plan for the water and agriculture sectors the following factors should be given priority • the provision of agriculture machinery and improving the efficiency of existing machinery and equipment thereby easing and eventually eliminating the mechanization crisis • the construction of water pump stations to be designed using the latest technological and engineering techniques the above clearly indicates that there are opportunities for foreign investors and companies to introduce their products and technology to iran however if the countrys production cannot meet domestic demand products can be imported into the country with the approval of the ministries of commerce and agricultural jihad the import of agricultural machinery is also allowed but is conditional to the fact that the ministry of commerce has issued the relevant permits at the moment there are only few items eg opium whose import is prohibited by law nevertheless the third development plan states in order to create employment opportunities and reduce foreign currency expenses the government shall be dutybound to import oil seeds into the country instead of the imports of cooking oil and oil cake in addition the ministry of agricultural jihad has the power to stop issuing or rescind import permits if it deems such action appropriate the export of agricultural products can be subject to some limitations if the producer has been provided with subsidies ministry of agricultural jihad wwwmoaorir iranian agricultural engineering research institute fanistart agricultural research education and extension

food market is moving toward a trend in convenience as evidenced by the many israelis who are eating more prepared foods fast foods and snacks demand for prepared and packaged food products is therefore strong throughout the country with continued growth projected for the privatelabel industry significant opportunities exist for canadian manufacturers in nearly all product categories the canada israel free trade agreement cifta which came into effect on january improves market access for agrifood products of export interest to both canada and israel canadas goals are to expand coverage of the cifta and secure longerterm opportunities for canadian agrifood products in key areas such as vitamins potatoes and pet food israel has a liberal import policy and has entered into free trade agreements ftas with several countries other than canada including the czech republic the european free trade area iceland liechtenstein norway and switzerland the european union hungary mexico poland romania the slovak republic slovenia turkey and the united states import licences have been eliminated although imported food items require the approval of the ministry of healths food inspection service this agency is also responsible for labelling and packaging requirements all plant material requires approval from the plant protection and inspection agency imported meat must be licensed by israel veterinary services ivs and originate from a processing plant that has been approved by the ivs israeli law requires all meat and poultry imports be certified kosher by the rabbinical council of the chief rabbinate or a body authorized by the council hence goods can receive kosher certifications from rabbis in canada but only with the concurrence of the chief rabbinate kosher is an important consideration in the export of food to israel with over of the countrys five million jewish population maintaining some degree of kosher observance and a moslem population of one million purchasing kosher food that meets the halal dietary requirement israel is the largest market in the world for kosher food although the import of nonkosher food is not forbidden marketing would be limited to a small segment of the market the large food chains processing plants and institutional market import only kosher food non kosher foods account for less than of the total food

biopharmaceuticals is the most significant sector of the israeli biotechnology market domestic biotechnology companies focus mainly on product development for cancer autoimmune syndromes and neurology

diseases neurology and cancer pharmaceutical and diagnostics firms represent of the israeli biotechnology industry agricultural biotechnology accounts for and the remainder includes veterinary and environmental applications sales revenues of biotechnology industry are estimated at billion in investments in israel were estimated at billion furthermore by israel is expected to account for of the global biotech market there is strong government support for the biotechnology industry within israel through programs to match research funding establish technology incubators and encourage binational cooperation however israel lacks regulatory infrastructure despite a rapidly expanding medical and pharmaceutical industry the israeli market is dependent on imported goods the pharmaceutical market including generic drugs was valued at billion in of which were imported drugs israels biotechnology industry is still in its infancy with companies including about incubator projects and approximately employees the majority of the companies focus on biopharmaceuticals three quarters of the companies are small startups with less than employees while a dozen companies represent of the total market value of the industry generate two thirds of sales and employ about of the industrys workforce in the last decade the number of companies increased by an average of per year while the sales generated by the sector grew by per year the challenge for the industry will be to move to the next phase of growth in which it nurtures more broadly based companies supported by the physical regulatory and scientific infrastructure necessary for long term growth the ministry of science culture and sports and the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry and trade supports the israeli biotech industry by providing longterm financial support for research and development rd projects to biotech companies enhancing cooperation between academia and industry to ward the commercialization of israeli biotechnology worldwide by encouraging international strategic cooperation and by assisting startups through a variety of support activities including incubators in the life sciences field there are seven universities five technical colleges and ten specialized research institutes engaged in advanced biotechnological research an estimated of all academic scientists in israel work in the life sciences field and spend of all academic research funding as a result israel has one of the worlds most skilled and educated work forces with more doctors scientists and engineers per capita than any other nation israel has a highly diverse population as a result of years of immigration providing researchers with a heterogenous population for clinical trial research lower costs for conducting clinical trials and a history of bringing new products to an advanced stage of development more rapidly than anywhere else in the world makes israel an attractive place for foreign companies to conduct clinical trials or establish research partnerships opportunities there are good opportunities in this market for canadian companies interested in rd partnerships and technology transfer agreements to take advantage of israels research strengths areas where major advances in biotechnology have been made include the use of molecular modeling to design new and improved drugs synthetic polyamino acids for drug development drug delivery techniques and drug design by peptide modification israel needs to invest further in the essential infrastructure to compete in the postgenomic era especially in basic research infrastructure and early stage commercialization currently israeli biotechnology firms tend to sell their early stage technology to international investors or multinational concerns rather than take the risk to develop the product further there is scope for combining canadian and israeli talents where canadian biotechnology companies can form strategic partnerships with israeli companies both at the pre and postcommercialization stages due to insufficient industrial infrastructure facilities for drug development and testing there are market opportunities for canadian companies to provide these services canadian companies can also work cooperatively with israeli companies to conduct clinical trials in israel where there is a high level of medical expertise lower costs and a diverse population base the canadaisrael industrial research development foundation ciirdf provides companies in either

aviv for more information contact the canadian embassy key participants israel is expected to become a major centre for the development of pharmaceuticals especially generic brands however in spite of recent growth the israeli pharmaceutical market remains relatively small and the israeli biotechnology industry has yet to achieve the level of the development of its international competitors particularly in the united states canada germany and the united kingdom the two main producers and importers of biopharmacuticals are teva pharmaceutical industries and agis industries which together have a combined market share in israel of other major biotechnology companies in israel include biotechnology general btg pharmos interpharm ipl and compugen privateand publicsector customers in israel reformed its drug import regulations to include major changes in pricing importing and approvals for new drugs for example medications approved by the us food and drug administration fda or the european medical regulations agency will be approved by the ministry of health in israel much more quickly than those that have not received such approval the fda and the israel ministry of health

sector received approximately million in venture capital an increase of from israels biotech strengths are in therapeutic pharmaceuticals bioinformatics agrobio animal and plant products and diagnostics israel has a highly diverse population providing researchers with a heterogenous population for clinical trial research lower costs for conducting clinical trials and a history of bringing new products to an advanced stage of development more rapidly than anywhere else in the world make israel an attractive place for foreign companies to conduct clinical trials or establish research partnerships the best prospects for growth in the israeli biotech industry are in bioelectronics pharmacogenomics proteomics bioinformatics and structurebased drug design opportunities are also available in the growing agricultural biotech sector where research is focussed primarily on the development of seeds and transgenic plants fish cultures and algae are also growing research areas prospective exporters are recommended to use the services of a local representativedistributor or local agent who has a thorough knowledge of the market and is wellconnected with key players market overview israel offers a sophisticated and diversified marketplace for goods and services despite its relatively small population of six million people israel is still a country with a high volume of imports both raw materials and finished goods the israeli biotechnology market was worth an estimated billion in and is forecast to reach billion by the end of with continued growth expected over the long term in israels biotech sector received approximately million in venture capital an increase of from the israeli government strongly supports the biotech industry with programs to match research funding establish technology incubators and encourage international cooperation pharmaceuticals diagnostics agriculture other including bioinformatics total source realizing its full potential downloaded from wwwircorgilbiotechverniahtm on february the israeli biotech industry has yet to achieve the level of maturity and development of its competitors particularly when compared to the united states canada germany or the united kingdom the potential for progress however is significant because of strong government support and the emergence of several large and mediumsized firms with sufficient infrastructure to develop and test new products the office of the chief scientist ocs of the ministry of industry and trade as well as the ministry of science culture and sport are responsible for biotech development in the country although there are several academic and research institutes in israel most of the countrys biotech research and development rd is centred around the weizmann institute of science and four universities agricultural biotechnology agricultural and veterinarian products account for of the biotech market in israel and over of countrys total biotech exports are in agricultural biotechnology approximately of research in this sector is devoted to plant biotechnology particularly the development of seeds and transgenic plants as well as biopest control the remaining is focussed on veterinarian biotechnology although genetically modified gm crops and food products are a significant topic of public debate in israel the government has not yet issued a policy on gm organisms a number of domestic companies are active in agricultural biotechnology including abic biobee agrogreen hazera gedera rahan meristem vitality and zeraim most agricultural research is conducted at the volcani institute and the hebrew university faculty of agriculture diagnostics diagnostics account for of israels biotech market but is expected to grow in the coming years most of this area of biotechnology is focussed on immunological and genetic assays for pathogens leading local companies include gamidagen orgenics rahan meristem and savyon medical biotechnology biopharmaceuticals are the most significant sector of the israeli biotech market however the distinction between traditional pharmaceutical firms and those employing biotechnology in the development of medical products is difficult to establish therapeutic pharmaceuticals account for of total biotech sales in the country the three leading therapeutic areas in israel include neurology disorders cancer and autoimmune systems disorders approximately of biotech drugs produced are in these areas other products under development currently include recombinant heparanase cell therapies for spinal cord traumas human monoclonal antibodies structurally shaped peptides and new drug generations there were domestic firms working in this sector in leading companies include pharmos peptor ltd insight omri xtl pharmaceuticals teva pharmaceuticals dpharm qbi enterprises keryx biopharmaceuticals and proneuron biotechnologies with sales totalling million annually swissowned interpharm is the leading multinational in israels biopharmaceutical market in spite of a rapidly expanding medical industry the israeli market is still quite dependent on imported goods imported pharmaceuticals accounted for approximately of the billion market in imports primarily originate from the united states switzerland germany belgium and the united kingdom canadian imports have had a marginal share of about in recent years key factors shaping market growth despite a thriving venture capital sector and a worldrenown academic infrastructure israels full potential in biotechnology has not been realized however the biotech industry is now on the governments national agenda and a strategy has been devised to support its growth over the next years there is strong government support for the biotech industry within israel through programs to match research funding establish technology incubators and encourage international cooperation according to the israeli industry center for research and development matimop the office of the chief scientist has established priority areas for the new biotech initiative • establishing two worldclass incubators dedicated solely to biotechnology • improving and expanding the industrys physical infrastructure and • providing funding through the ocsrun nofar program israel has a highly diverse population as a result of years of immigration providing researchers a heterogenous population for clinical trial research lower costs for conducting clinical trials and a history of bringing new products to an advanced stage of development more rapidly than anywhere else in the world make israel an attractive place for foreign companies to conduct clinical trials or establish research partnerships opportunities the israeli biotech market is a small emerging market that holds significant opportunities for canadian companies especially in strategic partnering with israeli biotech companies for joint rd and international marketing analysts predict that by the end of the number of biotech companies in israel will jump from to as many as israel is expected to become a centre for the development of biopharmaceuticals and generic medications the best prospects for growth in the industry are in bioelectronics nanotechnology pharmacogenomics proteomics bioinformatics and structurebased drug design the growing agricultural biotech sector also holds potential for canadian companies genetically developed hybrid seeds for fruits vegetables and cotton as well as fish cultures and algae are currently the main areas of research currently israeli biotech firms tend to sell their earlystage technology to international investors or multinational concerns rather than take the risk to develop the product further combining canadian and israeli talents could see additional development in both countries within this sector canadian companies interested in fostering rd relationships with israeli companies are

in the life sciences field there are seven universities five technical colleges and ten specialized research institutes engaged in advanced biotechnological research an estimated of all academic scientists in israel work in the life sciences field and approximately of israeli scientific publications are focussed on agricultural or healthrelated fields as a result israel has one of the worlds most skilled and educated work forces having more doctors scientists and engineers per capita than any other nation areas where major advances in biotechnology have been made include the use of molecular modelling to design new and improved drugs synthetic polyamino acids for drug development drug delivery techniques and drug design by peptide modification israel accounts for of biotech

for providing direct services to the public through the operation of autonomous heathcare units participation at annual trade fairs can help to develop company and product exposure to this market segment eilat is home to the countrys only freetrade zone all major ports offer goodquality warehousing but growing demand has rendered capacity problems israel has kilometres of standard gauge railway and km of highways there are eight main airports located primarily in the largest cities bengurion international airport is the largest channels of distribution good representation is the key to success in the israeli market prospective exporters are recommended to use the services of a local representativedistributor or local agent who has a thorough knowledge of the market and is wellconnected with key players importers agents and distributors exporters new to the israeli market are advised to appoint a local agent that has an understanding of the local market good contacts with the ministry of health the sick funds and other major players and the ability to promote products effectively there is an unspoken understanding and trust within israels business community that welcomes foreign partners and sales but looks for a local who knows you an importer of pharmaceutical products must have a licence and be a resident of israel or be a representative of a corporation registered in israel as a result canadian companies must either establish an office in israel or hire a distributor for their products for assistance locating an agent or distributor contact the canadian embassy in israel many other languages are also spoken the business environment is westernized but likely to be less formal in both dress especially during the summer months and the use of

information reports and advisories at wwwvoyagegccadestinationsmenuehtm canadians travelling to israel should pay particular attention to their personal security and follow news reports carefully as the security situation can change rapidly import regulations the government of israel requires that food and health products be registered with the ministry of health before they can be sold in the country sanitary regulations are governed by mutual agreements under membership in the world trade organization wto the ministry of health imposes strict controls on the importation of pharmaceuticals medical drugs and substances for their preparation may be imported only through a licence holder who is either an israeli resident or a representative of a company registered in israel to obtain a licence a registration of medicinal products must be submitted to the ministry of health since there has been a concerted effort to speed up the approval process for drugs imported from canada the united states the european union japan and australia accordingly drugs approved by the us food and drug administration fda andor the european medical regulation agency will be licensed by the ministry within two months rather than the usual fourmonth period free trade agreements have been signed by israel with the european union the united states the european free trade alliance and canada under these agreements there are no custom duties on pharmaceutical imports from these trading partners most imports are free of licensing and quantitative restrictions all imports are subject to a cost insurance freight value port fee as well as a valueadded tax vat the vat is recovered by the importer upon the resale of the goods and is paid ultimately by the consumer in the final retail price the israeli government has not yet issued a formal policy on gm organisms gmos however the country follows the european model for gmo labelling whereby products containing over of protein or dna from a modified organism must be labelled as such intellectual property protection israel is a member of the world intellectual property organization the paris convention for the protection of industrial property the patent cooperation treaty the universal copyright convention and the berne copyright convention as a member of the wto israel complies with the trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips agreement patents israeli patent laws protect both the process and the product and is granted for years from the date of the application subject to payment of renewal fees the owner of a patent must provide a local address when applying for a patent and the title must appear in both hebrew and english specifications however may be in either english or hebrew the first to file principal applies whereby the first or prior use of a patent does not protect the owner from infringement by someone else who applies first for a patent in israel the use of the services of a patent attorney is recommended generic drugs through and israel amended its patent laws to permit domestic manufacturers of generic drugs to develop generic versions of patented drugs prior to the expiration of the year patent protection for the innovator while the laws restrict production for use in research and for filing applications to regulatory authorities israel has no effective safeguards to restrict commercial exports the israeli pharmaceutical market relied previously on licensed technology from foreign companies or had to license their technology to largescale manufacturers israeli generic drug manufacturers have now become large enough to undertake the commercial development of pharmaceuticals these companies are opposed to any delay in rd until after the full period of patent protection has expired the revised israeli patent laws allow israeli generic alternatives to be marketed as soon as the patent expires when israels competitors would only be starting development of alternatives this gives israeli companies a jump start on generic drug competitors and generally results in israeli generic manufacturers gaining a larger portion of the market fearing the erosion of their competitive advantage the united states and the european union oppose israels revised patent laws and are considering taking the matter to the under the trips agreement furthermore the european union and the united states do not allow imports of generics while the patented drug is still protected and have threatened sanctions against israel over israels interpretation of the trips agreement this objection however will not prevent other nations from purchasing israeli exports canadian exporters are advised to follow this issue closely and take all necessary precautions to protect intellectual property trademarks applications for trademark protection may be made by the owner or their agent with written authorization from the owner all applicants must present a local address and pay the required fee of approximately the term of trademark protection is seven years but is renewable indefinitely for periods of years upon payment of required fees priority of registration is given to the first local user of the trademark and every application must specify goods or services falling within one class only under the terms of the paris convention where an application to register a trade or service mark in another signatory country has been made the applicant has a right to claim priority for registration of the same trademark in israel for the same use local standards certificates or registrations standard documentation includes a certificate of origin a commercial invoice and a bill of lading all imports into israel must have a label indicating the content weight and volume of the shipment the country of origin the name and address of the producer and the israeli importer in all instances hebrew must be used english may be added provided it appears no larger than the hebrew print in addition specific labelling regulations may apply to various types of pharmaceuticals exporters are advised to consult with israeli authorities or their local agentimporter to obtain specific requirements export credit risks restrictions on letters of credit currency controls despite the security situation and political upheavals conditions

overview lebanons agriculture sector accounts for of gross domestic product gdp and employs an estimated of the countrys labour force about of lebanons food needs are satisfied by imports and the diversity of imported food items is quite remarkable although lebanons agriculture sector has the potential to be one of the most productive in the region it is underdeveloped and poorly managed only of the productive areas are exploited often in an inefficient and wasteful manner major crops include vegetables tomatoes potatoes fruits citrus fruit bananas grapes apples olives tobacco cereals mainly wheat the major agriculture industries are wine expected to grow at between and a year olive oil and table olives and dairy milk production the agriculture sector suffers from lack of funding receiving just of the state budget in privatesector finance is equally limited with bank loans to agriculture accounting for only of bank credits the government has also introduced export plus a subsidy program aimed at assisting agriculture exporters with their crops vegetables fruit flowers and eggs agrifood transformationfood processing mainly for fruit and vegetables once considered to be a major part of lebanons agriculture and agrifood industry is almost nonexistent and requires substantial rebuilding the local distribution market suffers from the absence of government quality control a lack of marketing regulations and competition from lowerpriced products from border and neighbouring countries for the size of the lebanese economy the quantity and diversity of food imports are impressive in this small country food imports range from basic food categories to the finest foods wines and spirits total food imports are estimated at almost million us million for major

pulses seed potatoes meat canola oil finished products cannedfrozen food dairy products especially cheese confectionery and health and organic food with regard to the seed potatoes market regulations including sanitary barriers gross imported quantity and varieties to be imported are subject to yearly changes generally focus should be on price and nutritional properties as the lebanese consumer is

temperate mountainous region in the north a mediterranean maritime climate along the east coast hot and dry plains in the centre and desert conditions in the south of this land mass roughly is arable tunisian agriculture while important to the economy lacks modern infrastructure and features an unpredictable climate which has negatively affected the country’s ability to be selfsufficient tunisia also has few natural resources which has increasingly put a large constraint on its agricultural sector soil erosion desertification and rapid urbanization have depleted agriculture of arable land labour and water and reduced its capacity for satisfying the growing food demand of the tunisian population in an effort to combat these problems the tunisian government has implemented policies

seafood industry represents the second major source of food export and is a principal activity in the agricultural sector this industry contributes roughly of the agriculture value added tunisia’s common fish catch includes tuna fish shrimp cuttlefish and squid shellfish and mussels octopus sea bass and sea bream sardines as well as anchovies tunisia also has a food processing sector that is

these numbers have dropped due to political instability in the region and fallout from us terrorist attacks in however tourism numbers are expected to recover • in tourism revenues were expected to surpass ’s record earning of billion • to meet demands of international visitors the tunisian tourism industry requires a moderate amount of imported food consequently the sector represents opportunities for foreign suppliers of food and related services • generally the tourist industry is driven by visitors from four european countries germany france italy and the united kingdom these four nations contribute more than of tunisia’s tourist income other visitors to tunisia are from neighboring north african countries • in current terms there are roughly restaurants in tunisia catering to both domestic and international tourists • over half of all restaurants in tunisia are considered highquality these types of restaurants are most likely to purchase foreign foods and should therefore be the primary target of canadian companies selling to the restaurant industry • highend hotels import spirits wines and specialty cheeses either directly or via import companies in particular hotels and restaurants are excellent targets for alcoholic beverage producers • most hotels and restaurants in tunisia source their food needs either through annual tenders or using the same distribution channels as households competitors canadian exporters face tough competition from european countries the eu is tunisia’s major market approximately of tunisia’s exports go to the eu

free trade zone ahead of the target for trade barriers to end in the euromediterranean area over time this free trade zone is expected to encompass arab nations the united states also has trade relationship with tunisia through the united statesnorth african economic partnership which encourages increased twoway trade between usa tunisia and other maghreb states although canadian exporters

freetrade status with the eu tunisia has made changes to its tuniscarthage international airport and road and rail network improvements are increasing steadily berthing space and port facilities are undergoing continuous upgrading access issues canadian exporters must be prepared for bureaucratic hurdles when entering the tunisian market due to the country’s traditionally high tariffs that protect the country’s domestic industries particularly on consumeroriented products exporters of bulk and intermediate goods may also face red tape in recent years however the international monetary fund imf has urged that hightariffs be reduced as part of tunisia’s secondgeneration reforms the best way to access the tunisian food retail market is through suitable local importers who are experienced in working with modern retail outlets such importers are able to negotiate shelf space and promotional activities with supermarket chains canadian exporters are encouraged to check the credentials of tunisian importers another approach may be to contact retailers directly especially if exporters are interested in making large quantity shipments small grocery stores tunisia country report source their goods mostly from wholesalers and from certain importers who have their own distribution fleet to supply goods at the retail level tunisia’s business environment is generally credible long pants should always be worn by men while women are advised to wear clothing that covers the majority of the body especially shoulders and legs establishing a personal relationship with prospective business partners is essential in doing business in tunisia maintaining this relationship through regular visits and other forms of personal contact are also recommended because of the country’s emphasis on personal relationships cold calling or sending direct mail to potential clients or customers is not recommended tunisians perceive canadian goods as of highquality but businessmen may be reluctant to pay substantial premiums as price remains the most determining factor therefore canadian exporters should be prepared for relatively demanding price negotiations

report saudi arabia december this report is intended as a concise overview of the market for those interested in its potential and is not intended to provide indepth analysis which may be required by the individual exporter although every effort has been made to ensure that the information is correct agriculture and agrifood canada assumes no responsibility for its accuracy reliability or for any decisions arising from the information contained herein please address any comments or suggestions you have on this report to saudi arabia country report saudi arabia past present future report december overview saudi arabia is the world’s largest oil exporter with by far the greatest proven reserves of crude oil based on current output there are sufficient reserves for almost years of extraction this oil wealth has transformed the country’s economy although politically and socially saudi arabia remains highly conservative canadasaudi arabia relations canadian saudi relations are built on a strong bilateral trade relationship with trade increasing significantly since while imports from saudi arabia dominate trade canada’s exports have seen very positive increases exports reached a high in fell slightly in but maintained a level well above pre totals canada’s imports are dominated by oil with most trade value increases with saudi arabia a result of recent record oil prices • the value of canadas twoway trade with saudi arabia was approximately billion in canadian exports to the kingdom in totalled million a significant decrease of almost million from despite the decrease saudi arabia continues to be one of canadas largest merchandise export markets in the middle east and north africa canada’s largest export to saudi arabia in was barley followed by paper products vehicles and lumber canadas merchandise imports from saudi arabia in were valued at billion and consisted mainly of crude oil organic chemicals and refined petroleum products canadasaudi arabia bilateral trade saudi arabia total trade exports imports trade balance billion billion billion canadasaudi arabia trade million exports imports trade balance billion billion canadasaudi arabia ag trade million exports imports trade balance million suppliers are increasingly important players in the saudi market there has been success particularly in dairy production but the country is currently nowhere near self sufficient agricultural production saudi arabias agrifood imports in were estimated to be billion up from billion in barley alone represents of total agricultural imports canada is forecast to export tonnes to saudi arabia the country’s top suppliers of agricultural products include ukraine syria brazil india and the united states overview of agricultural trade between canada and saudi arabia canada’s exports were valued at million or roughly of total canadasaudi arabia agricultural trade in despite decreases in barely exports witnessed significant increases in a number of product categories for instance cheese and lentil exports both grew by over million even more impressive was the growth in exports of ground nuts million and ice cream million canada’s exports are dominated by bulk commodities namely barley and comprise of canada’s total bulk exports exports of consumer products have been increasing steadily since through to september of exports of consumer goods have already exceeded totals canada imported million worth of agricultural goods from saudi arabia in imports from saudi arabia have been in a slow decline since usually falling annually • sectors that have been identified as potential targets for privatisation include electric power mining aviation and telecommunications saudi arabia country report nonsaudi nationals and expatriates dominate the saudi workforce this policy has restricted the entry of foreign workers into certain job categories and led to a quota system that requires all companies to employ a percentage of saudis in their operations forecast while the economic foundation as a major oil exporter looks secure and economic diversification has proven beneficial to the economy there is little prospect of significant political and economic reform in the near future reforms must be balanced with the political aspirations of senior members of the ruling family and the wishes of the powerful clerical establishment and it is expected that any future reforms will be cautious and piecemeal plans to introduce an elected component to the national consultative council appear to be on hold consumer market overview saudi arabia is a diverse and highly urbanised society while the country remains difficult to access and the food market difficult to penetrate the country has become increasingly exposed to and influenced by western trends saudi arabia is the largest market for highvalued foodstuffs in the middle eastnorth african region • saudi arabias population is roughly million of which almost are nonnationalsexpatriates the kingdoms population is expected to almost double within years to more than million nearly of the population is under the age of with of the population born after riyadh is the capital city and the seat of government other major population centres include jeddah on the west coast and the twin cities of dammamalkhobar on the east coast most expatriates are from south asia ie india pakistan bangladesh egypt sudan yemen the philippines and east africa there are roughly american and british professionals residing in saudi arabia expatriates make up a majority of the saudi workforce in addition to simple staple purchases supermarket shopping is considered a type of entertainment to saudi families large play areas for children boutiques specialty shops and fast food restaurants have been incorporated into the grocery buying experience there are roughly supermarkets in saudi arabia and a significant increase in this number is expected due to the increasing popularity of western style shopping formats despite a western influence to supermarket formats all supermarket chains in the kingdom are whollyowned by saudi companies however western foreign managers are common until recently supermarket chains were dependent on local importers for sourcing merchandising and inventory control however the benefits of direct importing have not been lost on the larger high volume chains where this method is increasing in popularity importers are constantly searching for new products and often request support from suppliers for promotion the increasingly positive attitude of saudis to mass media advertisements means that advertising is considered a necessity to draw saudi consumers despite the perceived wealth of the population saudis can be a price conscious consumer market for instance twoforone deals have proven to be effective marketing ploys in large supermarkets private labels are becoming commonplace in saudi arabia it is not uncommon for foreign products to be given arab sounding names to appeal to local consumers some large saudi importers are willing to testmarket a new food product under the condition that if it succeeds the product will be labelled under their own private brand the limited ability of saudi women to drive cars has maintained the popularity of localcorner stores bakalahs these stores are present in every neighbourhood and are especially important in the housing compounds of expatriates despite the proliferation of supermarkets these corner or local stores continue to thrive and have greatly expanded their product base saudi consumers are selective but enjoy new food products and look for the best deal they are attentive to quality nutritional value price and packaging international fast food chains continue to expand and are found in major urban areas many of the international fast food chains and select local outlets have chosen to import a significant share of their required ingredients a number of international fast food chains and food and beverage companies are actively involved in the saudi arabian market competitors key competitors to products that canada currently produces are europe australia new zealand and the united states however longterm relationships that have developed between saudi arabia and companies from these nations have been strained by current geopolitical and economic circumstances leading saudi businesspeople to begin actively seeking alternatives to traditional suppliers this shift could present a number of significant opportunities for canadian exporters as canadian products are perceived as extremely competitive from both a quality and price standpoint similarly saudi arabia’s agricultural imports are dominated by five key markets ukraine syria brazil india and the us and five key products barley sheep goats frozen chicken rice and cigarettes american products are still a large player in the saudi food market but have suffered from a recent boycott american products are suffering due to consumer perceptions of political situations and while they have recovered from the most recent boycott a growing number of consumers and local buyers are seeking nonamerican products in the search for more nontraditional markets saudi arabia has been very active in improving regional relations in the hopes of strengthening trade relations with its neighbours saudi arabia is a member of the gulf cooperation council gcc which was established in to promote prosperity and security among organisation members member states also include the united arab emirates kuwait qatar oman and bahrain the gcc has approved duty exemptions covering the import of more than items including basic foodstuffs the council has also taken a number of steps to promote intragcc trade including the implementation of a customs union which has harmonised the customs tariff at of an items value the following is a list of some other consumer ready food products with high export potential additional • variety of food ingredients to meet the growing demand of the expanding processing sector access issues overview • foodstuffs imported freely with very limited nontariff barriers imports of alcoholic beverages live swine pork and food ingredients or additives which contain pork products including pork fat and gelatine are banned meat and poultry shipments must be accompanied by a halal slaughter certificate poultry and livestock meat shipments must show that they are from animals that were not fed animal protein ruminants and were not treated with any growth hormones transhipment of livestock meat through europe and other countries affected by bovine spongiform encephalopothy bse and foot and mouth disease are banned • getting a visa to visit the country can be difficult there are different tax systems for saudis and nonsaudis there is no valueadded tax sixteen areas of commercial activity have restrictions on foreign investment the willingness of saudi consumers to support boycotts of western products is a potential roadblock for exporters during periods of unrest in the middle east business travel tips • successful business relationships are very personal develop over time and maintain a positive air at all times carefully consider offers of hospitality they are important relationship builders but reciprocation is expected according to customs social and business contacts are for men only be cognizant of local prayer times businesses will typically close for short periods a number of times a day to allow for prayer visiting during ramadan is not recommended business will be difficult to conduct and visitors may find it very difficult to adapt their normal behaviour to the strict guidelines of the holy month these issues include restrictions on where when and what to eat and drink during the holy month western visitors are common and only offensive behaviour or dress will be noticed however the security of western travelers and expatriates has become an issue recently and necessary precautions should be taken the saudi government has set the task of achieving near selfsufficiency in food a daunting challenge as saudi arabia is one of the worlds most arid countries domestic agricultural growth depends on scarce water resources therefore recent development plans have sought to diversify products to crops grown with equipment using less water the government has made key decisions to limit mass production of products like barley in order to preserve the country’s limited water resources the domestic sector has benefited greatly from neighbouring markets as saudi arabia’s involvement in a regional trade group has given easy access to many of its products • saudi arabia is home to the largest integrated herd of dairy livestock in the world and has become selfsufficient in the production of eggs and poultry cereals and select fruits and vegetables in the saudi arabian agricultural bank lent us million to the agriculture sector which has greatly benefited in its expansion imports of key inputs for the sector will continue to grow along with sector development ie barley imports contact information for more information on saudi arabia canadian embassy in saudi arabia diplomatic quarter po box riyadh saudi arabia

introduction trademarket access pork beef fish halal products organics and other healthful matters retail hrifoodservice investment trendbitsrandom food for thought introduction without a doubt something in the governments vision as enunciated by the minister is clearly working for a change from the countless vision statements we have had to digest over many years whether corporate or governmental from all parts of the world including back home we think the actual visionary piece is in this case the driving element of the economic development success equation that is the uaes in nominal growth was over real at making this economy the th largest globally and th in terms of per capita gdp eg the us is th and canada th as i listened to a business show on a dubai radio station one evening the commentators seemed a tad apoplectic as a result of that days business headlines dubai is second worldwide in building offices and dubai airport records worlds second best growth the reporters queried each other endlessly as to whether such runnerup rankings suggested that dubai was losing its competitive edge as one might expect when cheering for the hometeam their conclusions would have done any chambre of commerce proudafter all moscow ranked first in office construction has roughly tentimes the population base and at current rates of passenger traffic growth dubai airport will overtake the venerable heathrow by we found this little exchange amusing as one gazes out most any window at a sea of construction cranes hanging over the dubai landscape but what it quickly makes apparent is the seriousness taken here at all levels in having the worlds biggest storage facility richest horserace purse tallest building first tiger woods designed golf course iconic architecture or whatever in short no effort is spared in undertaking projects with the objective of a numero uno ranking in the world and the bloodline of evergrowing commercial diversification in its many dimensions and away from petroleumdependency is what continues pumping life into the superlatives that frame this economy the drive to be first in the world manifests itself in some strange ways but again what would be the point in giving away such vital competitive information prematurely to the likes of singapore hong kong or even other gulf states all with their own designs on entering the tallestbiggestfirst sweeps to paraphrase a recent comment offered by stephen poloz chief economist export development canada the bottom line is that despite all the superlatives being used to describe dubai and by extension the emirates as a whole it still has the capacity to surprise for the arab region as a whole the council of the arab common market released its forecast in of the expected gap between demand and what is available in food product supplies by the gap will widen to million tonnes t including the need for million t of flour million t of sugar million t of edible oils million t of meat and million t of milk and dairy products the gap will result from both increased population growth and rising per capita income in the regionand dubai remains wellpositioned both with the needed infrastructure and expertise to service the imports and reexporting needed to meet this demand so back to sheikha lubnais there no fly in the ointment no caveat which might benefit from a little more governmental attentionis it all easy gravy for those choosing to do business here well not exactly this is not a market without its specific challenges it is worth noting for example that the world banks most recent fall global ranking on the ease of doing business in countries ranked the uae a lowly th indeed the uae placed only th among countries in the middle eastnorth africa mena region the ranking is based on factors used to assess the regulatory environment and its conduciveness to doing business to provide you with an idea of the range singapore ranked first the us and canada were rd and th respectively china rd and india at and agrifood exports to this market are not exempt from the challenges presented in this regard whether it involves trying to get additional canadabased halal certifiers approved or promoting canadian wines or the legal need to secure an emirati partner now being changed or the challenging shelflife dating requirements etc it is not a market for the impatientand building personal relationships over time is fundamental to any meaningful success so does all of this mean anything when it comes to canadian agrifood exporters potential interests in this market we would suggest yes and as an astute friend once taught mealways give them three things the gulf cooperation council gcc members ie saudi arabia bahrain kuwait oman qatar and the uae are generally booming along for a variety of reasons not the least of which are oil revenues one key strategic principle which underlies and promotes dubais growth is that it is designed to be a distribution hub within the region with respect to agriculture and food products this focus has been and remains an ever growing reality with redistribution occurring not only within the gulf and middle east but reaching furtherflung markets such as iran iraq russia india and pakistan to name but a few the considerable investment in stateoftheart infrastructure to achieve this end has occurred and continues to be upgraded in short dubai and the uae is far more than solely an export destination in its own right canadian agrifood exports to the uae now have a momentum to be capitalized on at time of writing our export levels by the end of november were up an impressive over our total exports for the range of opportunities run across the board from star hotels to a morethandoubling of cruise ship tourist visits expected next year to the huge expat worker camps continued growth the wellheeled westpat immigration whether as professionals or retireesin short they all gotta eat this first issue of trendsfood in the uae will explore some of the many trade development and trade policy considerations at play which from our perspective currently shape the uae market hopefully the reader will find some of the matters touched upon to be of direct interest or more likely will be encouraged to think laterally with respect to how the issues and opportunities identified might apply to hisher products or ideas even though not directly treated herein much of the statistical information contained in trends has been gathered from secondary sources all views expressed are those of the authors alone and are not to be confused with government of canada policy on any given matter trademarket access this newsletter is largely oriented to market trends and trade development opportunities however we assume that an overview of the trade policy issues and initiatives which provide some context for this market would be useful to those interested in pursuing its many opportunities the statistics bear it out the uaes foreign trade has made impressive strides in recent years commodity exports are expected to top c billion growing by from with oils share forming of these exports free trade agreements ftas for an essentially small country the uae is involved in an aggressive array of trade negotiations both bilaterally and as a member of the gcc a number of these negotiations are with suppliers that compete directly with canada even though at time of writing the uae had yet to sign a formal fta with any of its trade partners either bilaterally or through the gcc a number agreements border on reaching a conclusion on the bilateral front negotiations between the uae and the us continue although these talks appeared to be moving relatively quickly they reached a hiatus around march a few specific challenges not related to the agriculture fish or food sectors slowed things down ie telecommunications and inward investment for the uae and a us preoccupation with the emirates labour policies and employment conditions and although both sides softpedal the issue the dubai ports dp world fiasco also slowly seeped into the two countries commercial relationship and did little to enhance the negotiating mood with us trade promotion authority tpa expiring at the beginning of july and the results of the midterm elections having reshaped congress one would further assume that there would be little appetite in the us administration to expend the considerable political capital necessary if even possible to now push various potential trade agreements through the house and senate in practical terms a deal with the uae would have to be wrappedup by late march if there is to be any real hope of getting it through congress before the end of june when tpa expires uae bilateral negotiations were also underway with australia and singapore but have now been transferred to the gcc level as with the us we assume that any eventual gcc deal with australia will include the agricultural sector essentially for the same reasons as it would with the us in short its a winwin given the uaes and gulf generally food deficit situation and usaustralias strong agrifood export orientation however it will be interesting to see how the emirates attempt to protect some of their smaller less efficient food industries eg dairy products given that any eventual ftas with any trade partner having an agrifood export interest would force the uae to eliminate its restrictive protection measures most notably the use of productionshelflife dating in this regard on the multilateral front as a member of the gcc the uae also finds itself involved in a raft of multilateral negotiations in addition to singapore and australia these are underway with the eu china pakistan and india the eu negotiations started in and have proceeded in various fitsandstarts since initiation the eu is the gccs largest trading partner and the gcc is the fifth largest market for eu products senior level emirati political pressure eg most recently the publicised efforts of sheikha lubna the highly regarded minister of economy urging the eu to speed up gcc free trade talks continues to mount as well negotiations with china and india got underway in and respectively more recently singapore and the gcc announced that they would begin fta talks early in other countries including japan turkey new zealand switzerlandefta in parallel with the eus negotiations pakistan korea thailand jordan and potentially azerbaijan have all now expressed interest in or intent to begin fta negotiations on a gcc basis and as a final aside we would note that within the gcc the us has concluded bilateral ftas with oman bahrain and more widely within the region with jordan morocco and israel although all were not initiated by president bush each agreement is a supportive plank in his declared goal of establishing a middle eastern free trade area mefta however as noted above the reconstituted november congress will likely impede furtherance of this objective the bilaterals with oman and bahrain created considerable consternation within the gcc notably with saudi arabiathe regional heavyweight arguing that the ftas violate the gcc customs union this perceived undermining of gcc solidarity may also play in to the uaes current negotiations with the us trade policies the uae has been a contracting party to the gatt since and subsequently a member of the wto in it grants at least mfn tariff treatment to all its trade partners except israel and saw the customs union component of the gcc ie a common tariff for all members take effect in the uae has never been involved in any trade litigation under the wtos dispute settlement mechanism the wto published its first trade policy review for the uae in the report provides a comprehensive review of all uae domestic policies that could affect trade as well as sector policy profiles including agriculture and related activities this overview is freely available through the wtos website at httpdocsonlinewtoorggenhomeasp see document wttprs march pork as a muslim country one is of course excused to assume a very limited if any market in the uae for pork products the market is stratified into several segments retail outlets drawing on the resident expat community which in turn represents of the population base touristbusiness visitors which along with healthy portion of the resident expat community fuel a vibrant and growing hotel and restaurant sector and other market outlets which also continue to grow eg ship chandlers catering us military installations in the region etc in our fall visits to key uae importers with canada pork international a number of salient observations arose at retail the bulk of frozen product is purchased by filipinos who tend to be largely employed in the service industries price is the dominant factor in sourcing product for this group there are only retailers licensed to sell pork to the public ie spinneys t choithrams sons ltd and lalsnotably carrefour does not hold a licence the western expat subcommunity westpat particularly the growing number of european professionals rotating through as well as retirees settling in the uae suggests continuing growth in demand at the retail level for chilled cuts and processed pork products this could represent an initially modest opportunity for canadian suppliers however when coupled with an explosion in further hotel capacity expected over the next years ie plenty more tourists and additional demand for highend real pork and bacon products this could be coupled with foodservice and catering sector demand and build into a more substantive opportunity for those suppliers willing to invest the time needed to build the business relationships fundamental to this market indeed dubai will have some hotel rooms by the end of and experts are projecting rooms by although prescribed mandatory retail shelflives can pose a challenge in servicing the retail sector ie especially when it comes to chilled product air cargo transportation links from canada are continuously improving and should be able to minimize the effects of this limitation as well the limited timewindow prescribed under uae regulations for any food products dating requirement ie produced on and expiry on does not apply to the foodservice sector beef so how is canadas competition doing in the uae market there are clearly a number of reasons undermining canadas beef presence in retail coolersfreezers and on restaurant menus however with the uaes december acceptance of beef from canadian animals ie under thirty months of age and continued efforts to have additional canadian halal certifiers approved we hopefully look forward to canadian beef in this market over the medium term this market wants beef for example meat and livestock australia mla announced fall that the demand and consumption of australian beef per month has nearly doubled in the uae a year ago about tonnes of aussie beef were consumed per month but the amount has now shot up to about tonnes per month in a market that consumes a total of some tonnes per month the mla argues that it is their extensive investment in and commitment to offering a top quality product which has gone a long way in making their beef the ingredient of choice for chefs and patrons alike in most higherend dining and steakhouse establishments this commitment has also been bolstered by a number of other factors at play in the uae market itself high disposable incomes liberal trade policies zero or low import duties and of course a very limited local production of meat the general prosperity enjoyed in the market as well as the growing numbers of working women has meant eatingout is a fast growing trend as well another important and visible reason according to the mla is the continuing huge construction boom with a host of international hotel chains all offering fine dining experiences causing the demand for quality beef to grow exponentially in the words of one australian exporter whose volumes to this part of the world have doubled in two years who would have said two years back that we would be serving wagyu in most parts of the middle east today the anticipated growth in hotel accommodation over the next number of years is noted in several places in this report and underlies a lot of the continued growth expected in the uaes foodservice industry dubai for example aims to attract million tourists in with an objective of reaching million by fish theres no shortage of demand for fish in the emirates from the needs of the growing numbers of star hotelrestaurants aiming to satisfy the palates of their discriminating clienteles to fresh and in some cases live fish markets catering to nationals and resident expats to extensive fresh fish counters in all the major retail chains in terms of a domestic industry fishing in the uae is carried out mainly at an artisanal level on the supply side of fresh fish the country is considered selfsufficient with a catch of around tonnes which includes pelagics demersals and migratory species at given times of the year modern large fishing boats are prohibited in coastal waters in order to preserve the coastal environment as well as fishermens interests per capita fish consumption of uae nationals is estimated at kg this is high relative to other arab countries and the world as a whole fao world estimate of kg in the full gamut of frozen fish products including bagged iqf shrimp in all sizes from around the world are readily available at retail the range of more highly processed products is also extensive originating from eubased processors south africa australia malaysia oman and other suppliers likewise there is also an established market and consumer demand for smoked salmon and canned products in the fall a special section of the dubai fish market opened to cater to consumers seeking live fish emirates aqua live is the first such fish outlet in the uae and supplies both to individuals as well as top restaurants their special facility carries all the regional fish live crabs lobsters and others opportunity for canada canada currently exports a variety of fish and seafood to this market including fresh and frozen lobster frozen shrimp scallops and crab smoked salmon and canned fish products and the opportunities continue growing on the supply front considerable media debate was generated in the fall with dr worms dalhousie university ns extensive study published in the journal science as we understand it the study essentially argues that should current trends be maintained seafood could all but disappear from the human diet by within the context of the debate that this gave rise to in the uae the ministry responsible for the fishery submitted that the threat of depleted fish stocks will not affect the uae this the ministry attributed to the release of more than a halfmillion hatchery fish a year into the gulfand their efforts to release more as mentioned above they also underscored their not allowing big companies with trawlers to operate in coastal waters for our part we don t quite know how to square this with press headlines which scream price of local fish hits the roof and fish export ban imposed as traders struggle to meet demand but we suppose thats simply our failing halal products halal literally means what is permissible under islam halal food must be free of alcohol pork and other prohibited substances in addition meat and meat products must be from animals slaughtered according to islamic guidelines some recent reports have argued that most food companies in the region have not understood the direction the global halal market is taking and they will have to adapt if they wish to eke out a share of this growing market by adopting contemporary industry trends analysts note that food companies in most middle eastern countries take their consumers for granted compared to buying halal food in other countries consumers in overwhelmingly muslim countries are seen as accepting what is on offer without raising too many questions the halal foodwave has already happened in southeast asia europe and africa they suggest that it is just starting in the arab world and consumers are becoming more conscious of halal branding of food products it is believed that consumers in the region will buy halal products from nonarab companies if they do not find the properly certified products on their grocery shelves a study puts the global retail market for halal food at between us billion a year ie based on per capita expenditures on food by muslims a breakdown of the billion muslim consumers around the world suggests both a substantial middle eastern market as well as opportunities for reexport from dubai to other impressive market sizes million in indonesia million in india million in pakistan million in the middle east million in africa million in malaysia and over million in north america september saw the successful introduction of a new halal trade show dihas in dubai although only companies mostly from malaysia exhibited at this inaugural event the venture appears to hold promise for this growing segment and will run again in at time of writing the islamic society of north america isna is the only canadian halal certifying body that has been approved to certify for export to the uae however efforts continue with the objective of obtaining approval for additional canadian certifiers organics and other healthful matters organics domestically at the farm production level in the uae the ministry responsible for agriculture is encouraging the pursuit of organic farming mainly as an environmentally friendlier alternative to current practices the answer is a resounding no organic products are evident in most retail food product categories and canada continues to build a steady presence in this segment canadian breakfast cereals granola bars jams and wild rice are readily available on the organic supermarket shelves we believe that opportunities exist for a greater presence in this niche segment the december publication of canadas organic products regulations will now underpin consumers confidence against false organic claims and govern the use of a new canada organic logo organic exporters will now be able to compete on a far stronger footing internationally with the over other countries worldwide that have enacted organic regulations coupled with this regulatory framework is the launch in of a fouryear pilot project to track canadian trade data on organic productsa world first having this information available will prove valuable in measuring both performance and demand for these products in various markets in short these newest of tools auger well for the promotion of this specialised horizontal crosssector in the global marketplace including the uae of course diabetes one in every four uae adults is believed to be affected by diabetes according to the uns world health organization who this rate is one of the highest incidence in the world both diabetes and childhood obesity are major health concerns and the two go largely handinhand with type ii diabetes ie usually referred to as adult onset diabetes now growing far more common among younger individuals some of the uaes diabetic population are type ii which although not insulin dependant requires close management through proper food intake ie given a diets significant role in helping control bloodsugar levels indeed who has estimated uae youths to be times more obese than the international standard and the link between being overweight and diabetes is generally unquestioned this unfortunate situation does however present a number of opportunities for canada these can be seen not only in terms of specialty products aimed specifically at this particular segment but more significantly for products that are not only helpful to diabetics but support good nutrition principles for the population as a whole notable in this latter area is the success enjoyed by canadian pulse exporters which at time of writing have seen there exports to the uae rise by over when compared to last year alone as a staple pulses find themselves well positioned as low on the glycaemic index gi scale a feature which is particularly helpful to diabetics but no less healthful for the population at large as canadas pulse export base to this market grows promoting this key aspect of certain canadian peas beans and lentils will take on added significance in terms of positively identifying canada with healthy foods the same notion also applies to products like breakfast cereals based on oats barley or bran breads with wholegrains stone ground flour and the like for example the recent arrival of catellis healthy harvest wholewheat pasta line at retail in this market is illustrative of our ability to capitalize on this growing segment as are the natures path line of cereals this potential edge is not being lost on other exporters to the uae as well sona pearl nutri rice is a new scientifically engineered low gi aromatic rice marketed to health conscious adults and children at a gi rating of it is promoted as being less than half the level of most other rices other available products on grocery shelves include the likes of scotlands nairns line of oat biscuits and oat cakes they are clearly labelled on their front panel as to their medium gi or low gi ranking cargill has also entered the growing movement to the low gi approach by announcing its recent introduction of a new food sweetening ingredient xtendtm isomaltulose it delivers both glucose and fructose with their full energy but they are released over a longer period of time maple syrup yes that canadian stalwart is well represented on grocery shelves and yes it does feel a little strange following a piece on diabetic foods with a comment on maple syrup however the popular press has drawn uae consumers attention to the london phenomenon of significant success in weightloss dieting by drinking maple syrup we understand that london health food shops are reporting a massive surge in sales since popidol beyonce i ll have to ask my daughter said she used it to loose weight in her latest film apparently dieters mix the syrup made from maple and palm tree sap with water lemon juice and cayenne pepper and drink it instead of eating meals londonbased planet organics sell it as a detox product but customers soon noticed they could loose weight quickly with the concoction as well i won t venture any further at this point nor hazard a guess as to whether this phenom will catch on widely here as it has done in europeother than to note that this canadian of canadian products has received considerable media attention in the emirates on the healthful eating side of the ledger we eagerly consumed gallons of the stuff now as the media reports in this market the minnesota medical association has opened a new front in the war on obesity apple orange and other juices are blamed in part for the fattening of americas children in a somewhat less than vigorous defence one expert from the institute of medicine washington dc noted that juice is probably more nutritious than drinking water well again who are we to get caught up in the arguments of the nutrition experts we would note that fruit juice is not only a childrens drink in the uae but also an adult social staple in this islamic environment there is no dinner reception or other event where ample quantities of a wide and exotic array of fruit juices are not being consumed simply put fresh fruit juice is ubiquitous in this part of the world although the reported study findings did receive considerable media attention it is hard to imagine at this stage that demand for juices will abate in any significant way in fact a uaebased market research report found that consumers here are drinking more juice products approaching litres per annum with emphasis remaining on pure juices and nectars so during the limited review period covered by this newsletteron the healthful side in the uae thats apparently a thumbsup to maple syrup and a thumbsdown to fruit juicesinteresting but who might have guessed honey in yet another media splash focussing this time on honey also a great canadian product a new zealand biochemist visited the uae market to persuade health officials to put away the antibiotics and use the sweet stuff to heal injuries more specifically the product that is being brought to the uae combines honey with a clothlike material derived from seaweed which canada also has plenty of that dissolves away without leaving any threads to fester in a wound we might sound a little apprehensive about the good professor since the event that started him off on his quest was his use of bull semen given its antibacterial properties and that he first used honey when he accidentally cut himself with a chain sawbut there you go the professor is reported to have publicly volunteered to offer his advice freely to any company that wants to do anything seriously in our bid to have canada at the forefront of neutriceuticals and the like we say whats the harm in investigating further in terms of more traditional uses a very wide range of honeys are available on retail shelves both by typeflower origin and country source eg us germany uk australia nz china in addition to gulfproduct from oman and saudi arabia honey has always been an important diet component in this part of the world and is also traditionally served during ramadan observances in fact the qur an states that in honey there is healingand it is the only mention in the holy book of a food item in this context its sweetening characteristics are used widely from tea to yogurt in short its a competitive wellserviced market with little technically preventing canadian honey from being a player retail theres no mistaking it the uae is a shoppers heaven residents and visitors alike pound the retail corridors relentlesslyin fact recent ac nielsen figures estimate some million cumulative personhours are spent annually by uae residents in hypermarkets and supermarkets alone in case you re a reader attracted by factoids of dubious value thats equivalent to the hours that would be spent constructing empire state buildings a year and speaking of the us dubai has four times the shopping area per capita when compared to canadas southern neighbours the average uae consumer spends some hours in supermarkets per year and embarks on shopping trips nearly times every week retail and food retailing in particular is economically important and highly competitive retail prices as a nonmuslim outsider initial exposure to some of the practices which surround the holy month of ramadan expected to be september to october in gives rise to some unexpected yet interesting foodrelated phenomena readers would have knowledge of the sunrisetosunset fasting element observed throughout the month however we assume few would have given significant thought as to what happens once the sun falls one can readily appreciated that once the fasting day ends practitioners of the faith would understandably want to eat however the nature of this fastbreaking the importance attached to the evenings plentiful and celebratory meal iftar how this is often done as a community of one type or another be it family friends or any other groupings on a given night and of course the role food plays in this daily occurrence are all adjuncts that impact the food sector these centre on the placing of significant peakload demands on the various subsectors retail foodservice catering that must respond nightly in terms of quality variety and quantity of food products in turn these considerations present both many challenges and opportunities on the food supply distribution and sales systems at the retail level the print media for one closely follows retail prices and reports on same in considerable detail factions argue that increases in fruit and vegetable prices for example are a result of retailers falling prey to monopoly wholesalerswhile others counterargue that its simply the acting out of basic market forces so for roughly a day period food is a key component of media attention touching on everything from public health and the best ways to break a fast to traffic safety not a small issue in dubai with headlines like avoid speeding in rush to break your fast say police to reviews of restaurantsspecial offerings to import policy where in the uaes ministry of economy moved to allow the unrestricted importation of basic food items in order to avoid price manipulation to even having the leadership murmuring about the need for food price caps which even though not implemented is not inconceivable when one considers that a number of the emirates have recently moved to freeze soaring rents for example why is this of any relevance to potential canadian exporters well largely because its a leadin to pricing and availability at the retail level in short the uae government produces a retail price survey on a weekly basis which is widely reported on the calculations are based on a basket of items considered as essential although that term appears to be a little loosely defined the uae produces only of these items most of the local items include fresh meat and dairy products and some produce chicken beef and eggs are all produced in the uae as well as pasta tomato paste and sugar cucumbers and packaged beef samosas round out the list of locally produced items although these relatively few items are produced in the uae they must also face aggressive competition from imports as well its simply another illustration of the fooddeficit situation this part of the world finds itself in private labelling the rapid expansion of supermarket and hypermarket space across the middle east finds private labelling to be alive well and growing in the retail food sector uae food cooperatives on the other hand are ahead in terms of actual purchase percentages in the uae private labels now represent more than of supermarkets grocery turnover continued new growth pioneering french retail giants carrefour and casino are making the biggest investments in middle east food retailing with several other regional retailers trying to follow suit in carrefour acquired its first store in dubai as the result of a buyout thereby bringing the hypermarket concept to the middle east for the next six years carrefour essentially had free rein up until when the first géant from the frenchowned groupe casino opened in bahrain since then géantbranded hypermarkets have opened in lebanon saudi arabia and dubai plans have been announced to rollout further stores especially in saudi arabia with an estimated us billion turnover in the middle east carrefour is not sitting idly by from its initial foothold in the uae the brand now has upwards of stores most recently culminating in the largest hypermarket in the region located in dubai it is planning a raft of additional outlets ie bahrain qatar kuwait beirut cairo alexandria amman possibly more in the uae and perhaps iran but the cornerstone of the chains future development in the region appears to be its ambitious plans for saudi arabia carrefour is reported to want to launch more than additional stores in the kingdom over the next years their presence in the uae now includes stores the following table provides readers with a concrete idea of the relative size and ranking of only those major grocery retailers that also have operations in the uae understandably the retail banner sales in million uss used for the ranking relates to each chains total sales across middle eastnorth africa and is not to be confused with their respective total sales in the uae al maya considerable media attention was paid in to harrods reported plans to establish a presence on the dubai retail scene famous branded stores are of course already very present in dubai eg harvey nicholswhich features bcs canaqua spring water saks fifth avenue marks spencer etc however what caught our attention was that harrods was reportedly going to enter solely as a food and wellbeing retailer under the harrods name ie their relatively new conveniencehighend concept food store chain in the uk rather than introduce its full london department store format although analysts were predicting that harrods would initially focus on high quality convenience foods subsequent media reporting suggests that harrods entry into the uae market is not imminent in november marks spencer announced intentions to expand its current store presence in the uae as part of its global plans to open new international stores in and as we all know where ms goes their extensive line of quality st michael branded food products follows canadian products as the growth in canadas agrifood export statistics to the uae might suggest the good news is that keeping tabs on new products showing up on retail grocery shelves is a growing challenge the wellestablished ranks of mccain frozen potato products baskin robbins ice cream assorted pulses natures path organic breakfast cereals canola oil connors bros bumble bee brand canned fish products wild rice and maple syrupto name a few are constantly being added to most recent new arrivals have seen for example the catelli line of whole grain pasta products and canaqua bottled water in short uae importersdistributors we are in contact with continue to be enthused by canadian products and are very welcoming indeed encouraging of the canadian presence hrifoodservice the market the middle eastern foodservice market is estimated to be worth more than us billion annually of which the gcc countries account for almost us billion the uae foodservice market alone was worth us billion and is conservatively predicted to grow at for and dubai and abu dhabi account for of total foodservice demand amongst the seven emirates in addition to the uae resident populations considerable expenditures in this sector latest economic studies estimate total spending by tourists will reach us billion in which is expected to be the highest consumption rate in the gccand at three meals a day plus snacking on the run the foodservice segment will attract its own significant portion of that total outlay asian cuisine is the most popular of all cuisines and is growing the fastest lebanese food is also continuing to be popular as it suits arabic tastes and is also relatively healthy coffee chains are also showing excellent growth and canadabased operations are very active in this segment with franchises like second cup café suprême blenz café céramique and most recently java u from montréal all present in the market these channels make up roughly twothirds of total foodservice expenditure on their food inputs and supplies based on research interviews carried out with distributors in the uae the fastest growing categories in the segment are poultry lambmutton fresh fruit and vegetables and processed meat and poultry ie halal also noteworthy is the increasing popularity of lowfat versions of products asian sauces and ingredients bakery products coffee and specialty cheeses the major factors supporting growth in the uaes foodservice industry include population growth currently averaging over per annum rising rates of private consumption expenditure which also have the effect of driving up foodservice expenditures threequarters of the population are nonnationals with a large percentage of this segment being male bachelors in fact males outnumber females twotoone given the prevalent working lifestyle most people are compelled to eat at least one meal per day while at work and finally the impact of well over million and climbing relentlessly tourist visits annuallyhotels alone account for of total foodservice expenditure in fact dubai has set a target of attracting million tourists in and for those wanting yet another different spin on the hotel room growth number one of the worlds leading hotel investments services projects that luxury four and fivestar hotel rooms are expected to be completed in the next years across the uae by comparison las vegas is second with a construction pipeline currently at rooms and macao third at canada appears wellpositioned to take advantage of a number of opportunities in this market segment these would range from supplying inputs to the highly price sensitive fast food component eg from canola seed for crushing and use as frying oil wheat for milling and baking frozen potato products etc to important opportunities apparent in the hotel segment where premium fish and seafood products high quality beef and yes pork all come readily to mind fast foods according to several analysts traditional fast food outlets stand to face increased competition from companies billing themselves as both fast and healthy they are all eager for a slice of the uaes us million fast food market we know that in north america and europe the trend for some years has seen consumers gravitating towards what they consider as healthier eating alternatives and so as dubais consumer base becomes increasingly westpatoriented there could well be emulation in terms of a steady shifting away from traditional fast foods towards those healthier alternatives as well in support of this thesis some analysts suggest that consumers health concerns explain at least in part the somewhat unspectacular growth in uae fast food outlets they only reached this year when compared to in sushi gourmet burger and australian brand sumo salad have either been introduced to the uae or are on their way to do battle in their efforts to save consumers midriffs against this segments wellestablished mcdonalds burger king kfc pizza hut bulwark despite growing health awareness experts say there remains immense scope for growth in the uaes fast food market aware of this potential mcdonalds for example with its restaurants to date in the uae has introduced several meals directly targeting the mideast market such as the mcarabia grilled kofta and grilled chicken gross leasable area ie the retail space which is available to rent to tenants per capita in the uae is currently reported at the mark compare this to the us average of about and it seems evident to analysts that there is plenty of room for mall and nonmall retail growth and by extension plenty of room for growth in the fast food segment analysts predict with some confidence that the future room for growth will follow the growth trend of the mallsand the latter remains indeed very bullish franchising tourism and population growth across the middle east are creating new opportunities for the regions us billion franchise sector for example dunkin donuts the worlds largest coffee and baked goods chain has recently announced it intends to open new outlets in the uae alone during this us franchise has operated in the region for more than years and the additions will bring their regional presence to some outlets in the uae a number of canadian eatery franchises are in the process of or have already established themselves second cup blenz café suprême java u and café céramique have been previously mentioned but new york fries saint cinnabon and cinnzeo are also illustrativewith dixie lee chicken soon to open as well investment as most can readily appreciate a quick look around abu dhabi or dubai provides immediate evidence that the emirates are beneficiaries of huge investment capital inflows many of the worlds multinationals across all sectors continue to aggressively take advantage of the growth phenomenon that is the emirates as well as the gulf more generally over the last decade the uae has made significant strides and achieved the largest regional foreign direct investment fdi in terms of magnitude rising from a lowly th position worldwide in to rank th in however theres also ample evidence that uae companies are actively investing abroad as well again this straddles most sectors from real estate and hotel properties sport franchises port facilities to agriculture and food in terms of outward investment the media has india touted as the current greatest opportunity that doesnt mean that one is not barraged on a daily basis by nearconstant news of megahigh profile deal announcements in other parts of the world these range from constant rumours of purchasing liverpool fc a deal with an expected price tag of over c billion and for which the bidding has been against george gillett owner of the montréal canadiens emirates airlines heavy investment in arsenals new football stadium plus a c million fifa sponsorship acquisition of the tussaud group theme parks c billion travel lodge hotels c billion a billionplus stake in daimlerchrysler istithmars plans to spend over c billion in media and manufacturing in europe and north america and onandonfrom c million investments in the centre of beirut to c billion in egypts tourism development projects to international schools in singapore to moroccan agriculture the news barrage on this front is endless for many decades many indians seeking to advance themselves economically looked to the uae full of entrepreneurial skills they were eager to invest their efforts in making the vision crafted for dubai a reality and now we are witness to a steady stream of investment flowing in the opposite direction indias retail sector stands at c billion and growing at a year carrefour europes largest and worlds second largest retailer is in talks with dubais landmark group about opening up to stores in india over the next years this foray would take advantage of indias lack of a major international food retailing chain despite the growing demand of the expanding middle class for quality and variety from food retailers it would also dovetail nicely with indias annual growth in organized retail notably malls by contrast the uks tesco has seen its india plans skid to a halt as its negotiations with an indian joint venture partner bharti enterprises came to an abrupt end bharti is now aligning itself with walmart the point of all this is simple the uae both welcomes investment but likewise appreciates the importance of balancing risk by looking to invest aggressively around the world and across a wide range of sectors as well in this respect it clearly presents an interesting opportunity for sourcing potential fdi in the canadian agrifood sector trendbits random food for thought new products after years of intensive scientific research at the central veterinary research laboratory dubai emirates industry for camel milk products has released its first camel milk product camelicious to the uae market indeed the dateflavoured version is claimed as a worldfirst so you ask of what possible significance is this to canadian agrifood exporters well the product launch pickedup extensive media coverage in late and although taste panel results largely among expats were mixed the marketing focus plays generously on one of the recurring themes in this newsletterhealth and nutritional awareness of products will continue growing in the uae and will increasingly become an important food marketing tool will your humble servant try it you betcha eventually horses december saw a fulsome canadian equestrian industry participation as exhibitors within a canada pavilion at the al fares equine trade fair dubai the fair which is considered the number exhibition for horse products and services in asia and africa occurs every two years the event included the largest canadian presence yet with some nine exhibitors as well as two canadian expert speakers contributing to the various seminars held at the venue animal welfare yes the animal rights element of the sector have begun to make their presence felt in this part of the world as well in taking on australian live sheep exports some per annum to the uae usbased peta people for the ethical treatment of animals lobbied at the ministerial level arguing that the weeklong journey is not halal petas same campaign in qatar likewise received considerable media coverage as one would expect meat and livestock australia mla launched an aggressive rebuttal to petas claims noting that our colleagues in the middle east need to be aware that peta cannot be trusted and this is just another example of the havoc petas games cause the bottom line is simply that as in other developed country markets the animal welfare issue is now also making its way to the gulf in a visible way cruise ships those affluent mouthstofeed just keep on coming dubais cruise tourism industry is set for a major turn in its fortunes in after years of slow growth as the emirates modern infrastructure and positive tourism attitude attracts more visitors dubai is expected to see passenger movements during the winter cruise season which is more than three times the previous years arrivals the season is projected by the tourism authority at visitors via cruise lines with a dedicated cruise terminal able to handle two ships simultaneously the city is trying to position itself as the regional cruise hub goji berries again with the health already media coverage in the emirates was also afforded this particular berry which grows on hymalayan vines touted as a superfruit which is claimed to boost sex fight cellulite and combat cancer it is packed with nutrients and viewed to be in a different league than acclaimed superfruits like blueberries and black currants the growing presence in the uae market of neutriceuticals herbals antioxidents supplements et al suggests that it is probably time for canadas own particular entries eg hemp flax vegetablebased omega etc to begin exploring these opportunities as well we recommend a visit to the middle east natural and organic products annual trade show held in dubai in december as a good initial starting point in terms of investigating the potential offered by this segment this particular venue brings together all those involved in this industry directly or indirectly under one roof whats in a name in egypt the name of an influential personality is chosen every year and is then applied to the finest grade of that years dates this year hezbollah leader hassan nesrallahs name was chosen by a wide margin for the premium dates which cost over c per kgthe next lower grade earns about c per kg other than being generally interesting and no we are not advocating a cause or group in any particular waywe feel that it is probably noteworthy when contemplating markets in this part of the world that there is merit in reflecting on the significancemeaning of ones product name or personalityassociation carefullythe risks andor rewards for doing so might not always be readily apparent and lastly in november huguette labelle chair of transparency international released that organizations corruption index for we are pleased to report that the emirates ranked as the least corrupt of the gcc countries and st overall i suppose that depends on ones perspective for example canada ranked th and the us th whereas the likes of israel south korea and brazilchinaindiamexicosaudi arabia the latter as a group pickedup rankings of and respectively so yes we believe it to be a relatively solid endorsement of the uae business environment indeed not all carbohydrate foods are created equal in fact they behave quite differently in our bodies the glycaemic index describes this difference by ranking carbohydrates according to their effect on our blood glucose levels choosing low gi carbohydrates those that produce only small fluctuations in our blood glucose and insulin levels is considered by experts to be

reputation of israels work force as well as lower costs for conducting clinical trials and a history of bringing new products to an advanced stage of development more rapidly than anywhere else in the world makes israel an attractive place for foreign companies to conduct clinical trials or establish research partnerships there is strong government support for the biotechnology industry within israel through programs to match research funding establish technology incubators and encourage binational cooperation however despite a rapidly expanding medical and pharmaceutical industry the israeli market is still quite immature and dependent on imported goods in order to reduce the costs of medication and encourage more competition in the market the health and justice ministers signed

of the israeli biotechnology industry agricultural biotechnology accounts for and the remainder includes veterinary and environmental applications biopharmaceuticals are the most significant sector of the israeli biotechnology market however the distinction between traditional pharmaceutical firms and those employing biotechnology in the development of medical products is difficult to establish as the science behind biotechnology develops many traditional pharmaceutical companies are turning their attention to the potential of biotechnology in both product development and manufacturing technologies the estimated domestic value of the pharmaceutical market in israel in was billion growing at an average rate of about annually sales by domestic manufacturers totalled billion in of total sales were exported in spite of a rapidly expanding medical industry the israeli market is still quite dependent on imported goods imported pharmaceuticals were approximately of the total market

both france and germany annual otc consumption in israel averages per capita well below average for most westernized countries the otc market is predicted to be one of the most promising growth sectors in coming years there is strong government support for the biotechnology industry within israel through programs to match research funding establish technology incubators and encourage binational cooperation see the key contacts section for a complete listing of biotechnology incubators the ministry of industry and trade sponsors training projects or industrial incubators which partner new immigrants to israel who have backgrounds in science and technology with experienced israeli entrepreneurs the mentors role is to assist with the process of moving promising ideas through research and to commercialization the program has been very successful particularly with russian immigrants who have the technical experience in life sciences but had not previously been encouraged to pursue individual initiative the national biotechnology steering committee established in advises the israeli government on the development of biotechnology encourages research and entrepreneurial activities and promotes international cooperation government support also extends beyond research and development to include grants and incentives for startup costs marketing and infrastructure development the magnet program administered by the ministry of industry and trade encourages development of innovative generic technologies through collaborations between industry and the scientific community magnet will underwrite up to of a projects budget in four biotechnology projects received funding under this program in the program received a budget allotment of million over five years magnet also established a bioinformatics consortium called daat to encourage collaboration among companies and academic institutes daat received funding of million over years in order to bridge the

is a public nonprofit organization that promotes joint industrial development of advanced technologies the programs web site contains a database outlining cooperative program opportunities that span a range of advanced technologies key factors shaping market growth in spite of having the scientific knowhow and personnel the israeli biotechnology industry has yet to achieve the level of maturity and development of its competitors particularly the united states canada germany and the united kingdom while there has been some progress over the past decade with strong government support and the emergence of several large and mediumsized firms with sufficient infrastructure to develop and test of drugs further expansion of the infrastructure is needed as well as the development of entrepreneurial ability in management the israeli biotechnology organization is currently working in cooperation with the israel manufacturers association in implementing a fasttrack management program aimed at matching successful executives with israeli startup companies other developments to encourage growth in the biotechnology industry in israel include the clal biotech fund led by clal biotechnology a group of investors established a million consortium to invest in biotechnology companies in the group invested million in compugen and million in neuro survival technologies the clal biotech fund is currently examining three investments in foreign companies in the us and europe in addition to the clal biotech fund koor group and the israel corporation among israels largest holding companies have jointly established a million fund dedicated to biotechnology investments the ministry of science in cooperation with the weizmann institute of science established the israel national node inn for bioinformatics training and support in the institute is part of the governments effort to strengthen rd and manufacturing infrastructures by encouraging closer collaboration between academia and industry israel has a strong reputation for a highly skilled work force lower costs for conducting clinical trials as well as a history of bringing new products to an advanced stage of development more rapidly than anywhere else in the world israel also has a highly diverse population as a result of years of immigration providing researchers a heterogenous population for clinical trial research israel also has a welldeveloped medical infrastructure universal health insurance system and considerable number of physicians companies from the united states and the european union are increasingly interested in the research and development environment in israel further encouraging growth in the industry there are hundreds of biotechnology projects currently being developed in israel most of which receive government funding a notable change in emphasis in recent years has been a move away from development of diagnostics and agricultural products to research on new pharmaceuticals areas where major advances have been made include the use of molecular modeling to design new and improved drugs synthetic polyamino acids for drug development drug delivery techniques and drug design by peptide modification in israel announced reformed drug import regulations that included major changes in pricing importing and approvals for new drugs as described in more detail below medications approved by the us food and drug administration fda or the european medical regulations agency will be approved by the ministry of health in israel much quicker than those that have not received approval further changes as of february included allowing parallel drug imports in the past any company registering an imported pharmaceutical with the ministry of health had a monopoly on the drug whereby drugs were imported only by representatives with exclusive agreements with the manufacturer in response to proposed changes to allow parallel imports representatives of international pharmaceutical companies established a nonprofit lobbying organization called pharma israel to oppose the measure the association members argued that medications supplied by the manufacturer ensure the quality of handling packaging storage and transportation they also argued that parallel imports may threaten intellectual property rights the government argued in return that parallel imports would increase competition in the industry and could reduce the costs of some medications in israel on may the ministers of health and of justice signed regulations allowing parallel imports the regulations were signed after clalit health services filed a lawsuit and the high court of justice responded by demanding an explanation for the delay despite continued opposition from international pharmaceutical companies the regulations will take effect on september the united states and germany are israels most active scientific collaborators with programs including the

israeli partners can help canadian firms with technical expertise and commitment to ongoing research and development to enter the market through strategic alliances and technology transfer agreements best prospects for growth in the industry are in bioelectronics bioinformatics pharmacogenomics proteomics and structure based drug design pure biotechnology drug discovery requires greater investment and a longer development time postponing marked growth in this sector until the israeli market matures currently israeli biotechnology firms tend to sell their technology to international investors or multinational concerns rather than take the risk to develop the product further competitive environment local capabilities in spite of recent growth the israeli pharmaceutical market remains relatively small the two main producers and importers teva pharmaceutical industries and agis industries have a combined market share of these and other companies including biotechnology general btg

canadian embassy in israel suggested business practices the two official languages of israel are hebrew and arabic but english is widely spoken as the language of business and the one preferred for promotional materials most signs in public places are in all three languages yiddish russian french and german are prominent among the languages used by immigrant groups the business environment is westernized but likely to be less formal in both dress especially during the summer months and the use of first names without titles common office hours are from am until pm sunday to thursday and from am until pm on friday israel has no formal constitution it has a modern independent legal system based on a number of basic laws covering key areas of public life such as the electoral system the knesset parliament and the legal system as well as british case law which effectively enforces property and contractual rights moreover israeli civil procedures provide that judgments from foreign courts may be accepted and enforced by local courts the financial sector is modern and efficient with a full range of financial institutions and instruments there are few restrictions on foreign investment and investors and the regulatory environment and tax system favour foreign companies and investors the consular affairs bureau of the department of foreign affairs and international trade dfait provides countryspecific travel information reports and advisories intellectual property protection israel is a member of the world intellectual property organization the patent cooperation treaty the paris convention for the protection of industrial property the universal copyright convention and the berne copyright convention as a member of the wto israel is currently revising its laws to bring them into compliance with the trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trip agreement patents israeli patent laws protects both the process and the product and is granted for years from the date of the application subject to payment of renewal fees the owner of a patent must provide a local address when applying for a patent and the title must appear in both hebrew and english specifications however may be in either english or hebrew the first to file principal applies whereby the first or prior use of a patent does not protect the owner from infringement by someone else who applies first for a patent in israel the use of the services of a patent attorney are recommended generic drugs through and israel amended its patent laws to permit domestic manufacturers of generic drugs to develop generic versions of patented drugs prior to the expiration of the year patent protection for the innovator while the laws restrict production for use in research and for filing applications to regulatory authorities it has no effective safeguards to restrict commercial exports the israeli pharmaceutical market previously relied on licensed technology from foreign companies or had to license their technology to largescale manufacturers israeli generic drug manufacturers have now become large enough to undertake the commercial development of pharmaceuticals these companies are opposed to any delay in research and development until after the full period of patent protection has expired the revised israeli patent laws allow israeli generic alternatives to be marketed as soon as the patent expires when israels competitors would only be starting development of alternatives this gives israeli companies a jump start on generic drug competitors and would likely result in israeli generic manufacturers gaining a larger portion of the market fearing the erosion of their competitive advantage the united states and the european union oppose israels revised patent laws and are currently considering taking the matter to the wto under the trip agreement furthermore the european union and the united states do not allow imports of generics while the patented drug is still protected and have threatened sanctions against israel over israels interpretation of the trip agreement this objection however will not prevent other nations from purchasing israeli exports canadian exporters are advised to follow this issue closely and take all necessary precautions to protect intellectual property trademarks applications for trademark protection may be made by the owner or their agent with written authorization from the owner all applicants must present a local address and pay the required fee of approximately the term of protection for a trademark is seven years but is renewable indefinitely for periods of years upon payment of required fees priority of registration is given to the first local user of the trademark and every application must specify

applicant has a right to claim priority for registration of the same trademark in israel for the same use import regulations free trade agreements have been signed with the european union the united states the european free trade alliance and canada under these agreements there are no custom duties on pharmaceutical imports israel pursues a liberal import policy under which tariffs on products from most thirdparty countries were lowered to between and by most imports are free of licensing and quantitative restrictions all imports are subject to a cif costinsurancefreight value port fee as well as a valueadded tax vat of the vat is recovered by the importer upon the resale of the goods and ultimately paid by the consumer in the final retail price the ministry of health imposes strict controls on the importation of pharmaceuticals medical drugs and substances for their preparation may be imported only through a licence holder who is either an israeli resident or a representative of a company registered in israel to obtain a licence a registration of medicinal products must be submitted to the ministry of health as of there has been a concerted effort to speed up the approval process for drugs imported from the united states canada the european union japan and australia accordingly drugs approved by the united states food and drug administration fda andor the european medical regulation agency will be licensed by the ministry within two months rather than the usual month period regulations regarding the pricing of imported drugs were introduced in by the minister of health the previous regulations saw the importer use the price in the country of origin as a basis for the price in israel officials argued that this policy created artificially high prices by encouraging importers to purchase drugs from expensive sources the new regulation calls for prices to be set based on the lowestaverage price in belgium france germany and the united kingdom local standards certificates or registrations all imports into israel must have a label indicating the country of origin the name and address of the producer and the israeli importer the content weight and volume in all instances hebrew must be used english may be added provided the print is no larger than the hebrew print in addition specific labelling regulations may apply to various types of

agrifood exports to israel in totalled million the leading exports included lentils nonalcoholic beverages pet food beans sweet biscuits and peas canada is israels top supplier of dried leguminous vegetables and is among the top three suppliers of soybeans and pet food the israeli food market is moving toward a trend in convenience as evidenced by the many israelis who are eating more prepared foods fast foods and snacks potential opportunities are available to exporters in several categories including ready meals savoury snacks sauces and spreads the bakery confectionery and pet food sectors are also promising markets for foreign goods israel is already a major importer of canadian grains oilseeds and pulses with continued demand expected for the foreseeable future canadian winesparticularly ice winesare wellplaced to develop a market share in israel with the forecast growth of the privatelabel industry significant opportunities also exist for canadian manufacturers in nearly all product categories israels domestic foodprocessing sector is large diverse and fairly modern by international standards due to kosher requirements of the majority of the countrys citizens israel has been forced to develop a relatively large foodprocessing sector although nonkosher food products are produced and imported into israel together they account for less than of the food market and their marketing channels are limited exporters are therefore advised to export kosher products in order to achieve widespread distribution it is recommended that exporters consult with their

controls promotional events key contacts and support services bibliography other reference material market overview israel offers a sophisticated and diversified marketplace for goods and services despite its relatively small population of million israel is still a country with a high volume of imports both raw materials and finished goods israel is experiencing an economic slowdown related to the intifada the world downturn and the hightech slump most sectors remain far below the peaks of and only weak recovery at best is forecast for this year the security situation has seen its greatest impact on traditional sectors such as tourism construction and agriculture more significant overall has been the international economic slowdown particularly given its impact on israels important hightech sector and technology exports on which a considerable part of israels economic boom had rested nonetheless israels new economy has shown remarkable resilience in the face of severe strain there is a sense among analysts and the business community that the business cycle will eventually turn around the united states accounts for approximately of agrifood imports in canadian agrifood exports to israel totalled million the leading exports included lentils nonalcoholic beverages pet food beans sweet biscuits and peas by mid chickpeas were the top export followed by beans peas pet food prepared fruit jams and lentils kosher kosher which means right or clean describes foods and practices that are specifically permitted by jewish dietary laws with over of the countrys five million jewish population maintaining some degree of kosher observance and a moslem population of one million purchasing kosher food that meets the halal dietary requirement israel is the largest market in the world for kosher food nonkosher food products including locally produced and imported products account for less than of the food market and have limited marketing channels although the import of nonkosher food is not forbidden except for specific restrictions concerning meat and poultry products its marketing in israel is difficult approximately half of the jewish population consumes only kosher foods and most of this group does not shop in stores selling nonkosher products therefore the large consumer chains and many stores do not carry nonkosher goods the large foodprocessing plants also forgo the use of nonkosher raw materials in order not to lose this market segment the israeli government monitors compliance with labelling requirements through the ministry of health labelling of a foodstuff as kosher requires the certification of a rabbi by law the chief rabbinate is responsible for kosher certification although it can delegate its authority to others hence goods can receive kosher certifications from rabbis in canada but only with the concurrence of the chief rabbinate see key contacts and support services for a list of kashrut authorities in canada rabbinical leaders of the ultraorthodox sector contend that kosher certifications of the israeli chief rabbinate do not meet the kashrut demands of their communities for maximum market coverage to the orthodox andor ultraorthodox market segments products need additional certifications by some or all of the four main religious groups foodstuffs may carry special orthodoxultraorthodox certifications to facilitate penetration of additional markets exporters who wish to maximize their markets should comply with at least the chief rabbinate requirements many food manufacturers in israel display at least two kosher certification labels on their goods the chief rabbinate plus an individual approval by one of the orthodox or ultraorthodox sects key factors shaping market growth although israels food sector tends to be less sensitive to the overall economy than other sectors food retailers have noted that consumers have become price sensitive and have reduced their purchases of luxury or highpriced items hostilities in the region have also resulted in a significant decline in the number of people patronizing supermarkets according to a study carried out by an israeli news station in july consumers are visiting shopping centres only half as much as they were in shoppers fear being caught in terrorist attacks which often focus on shopping centres and other public spaces food exports fell in to million compared with the previous year elite industries ltd for instance has reported a drop in sales of impulse products such as salty snack food and chocolate in the fourth quarter of decreases in sales the company maintains came as a result of the decline in tourism pedestrian traffic and visits to entertainment complexes economic slowdown due to israels security situation has not greatly affected the market for foreign products however in fact imports actually grew by in totalling million israels manufacturers associations food division have called on the government and consumers to buy locally made food products especially during these reversionary times opportunities there are promising opportunities for canadian exports in several food categories strong growth in this sector is largely attributed to an increase of instore bakeries and patisseries in supermarkets which reflect the growing trend in israel to buy rather than bake sales of bakery products are expected to reach billion or million tonnes by the most popular bakery products include fresh bread which accounts for approximately of instore bakery sales sweet biscuits cakes savoury baked items eg filled filopastries and layered pastry leaves such as jakhnun and malawah and pizza roldin israels largest manufacturer of baked products produces different products including cakes breads cookies and special products elite industries ltd is also a major supplier of wafers cookies and cakes many bakery items that are western staples including english muffins some varieties of cakes north americanstyle bagels and croissants have not been wellreceived in the israeli food market items such as pizza and frozen and chilled dough however are in high demand opportunities for unique varieties of sweet biscuits and crackers are also available although competition from local and european producers is fierce sales of frozen bakery products are expected to grow steadily until at least reaching sales of million canadian exports of bakery items totalled almost million in sales of sweet biscuits which accounted for of total canadian exports last year are expected to offer continued growth potential in the years to come because the ingredients used in the production process of baked goods are so varied exporters are advised to consult with israeli importers to provide the specific guidance with regard to kosher certification for their products additional certification may be required if eggs are present in the product breakfast cereal is a category with tremendous growth potential opportunities are available for unique andor healthy varieties of breakfast cereal although sales of privatelabel breakfast cereals have not been significant to date demand is steadily increasing privatelabel cereal is expected to be a huge market in years to come the united states which supplies one third of the million market is canadas main competitor in the market pasta is among the fastestgrowing items in terms of sales israels noodle and pasta market is currently estimated at million annually with a estimated value of million by exports of uncooked pasta from canada jumped from in to in and have the potential for continued growth as demand grows confectionery products israel is a promising market for imported confectionery products chocolate is the bestselling segment of the confectionery sector approximately million tonnes of chocolate was sold in with sales expected to reach million tonnes by chewing gum and sugar confectionery products other than chocolate are expected to reach sales of and tonnes respectively by chocolate confectionery is expecting sales of million in while gum and sugar confectionery are expected to reach million and

for special occasions with sales of million in elite industries ltd is the domestic leader in israels chocolate and confectionery market its confectionery product line includes chocolate bars moulded and enrobed chocolate and chewing gum carmit candies the israeli distributor of cadbury chocolates is the countrys leading manufacturer of marshmallows although it has only a share of the chocolate

of chocolate confectionery products from canada were negligible israels growing confectionery provides room for highquality canadian products sugarfree and lowcalorie confectionery products in particular are the fastestgrowing market segments in this category fish and seafood in israels fish industry accounted for only of the countrys agricultural production the fish sector in israel is limited to freshwater fishing in the sea of galilee saltwater fishing in the mediterranean sea and aquaculture facilities located in northern israel research is being conducted to determine if edible fish can be raised through thermal water sources in the south future imports might decrease if this research proves successful in the mean time the majority of fish and seafood consumed in israel will

kosher if it has fins and scales grains oilseeds and pulses israel relies on imports to meet of its grains and oilseeds demand these thirsty crops are not commonly grown in israel because of their heavy dependence on water barley barley is primarily used in israel as a food supply for livestock it is also used as the basic ingredient for beer as well as an ingredient in soups and stews local production of barley is concentrated in the arab sector mainly bedouin in the negev area and to a lesser extent in the jewish sector where it is planted only for hay or silage in total domestic production amounted to tonnes due to the high price for barley local production is expected to drop to tonnes in imports of barley most of which come from the black sea basin including bulgaria and the ukraine showed a rising trend in the s but dropped significantly in due to steep price increases imports are forecast to rise again however in as local production is reduced the canadian wheat board cwb holds a monopoly on canadian malt barley sales to domestic and international customers sales are made in two ways the cwb works directly with customers to negotiate the purchase price and delivery conditions and secondly accredited exporting companies purchase malt barley from the cwb for sales on their own accounts exporters should note that most animal feeds and feedgrains do not require kosher certification pulses pulses particularly chickpeas dried beans and lentils are an important part of the local diet israel imported approximately tonnes of dry beans in this figure is expected to grow at an annual average rate of in and resulting in excellent opportunities for export sales of kidney beans small white beans and great northern beans israels lentil imports have increased with an average annual growth rate of over the last five years the country produces only tonnes annually due to harsh climatic conditions domestic demand and local production of chickpeas vary from year to year however as a result of substantial investments local production of chickpeas has been increasing steadily during the last years with an average growth rate of most chickpea suppliers to israel are from the united states and the european union however new trade partners such as turkey and countries from the former soviet union have also increased their share of the chickpea export market to israel through trimming costs due to proximity and cheap labour israeli imports of dry peas will continue to be a strong market for canada due to growing domestic consumption and the inability of local production to meet domestic demand most israeli pulse importers are small companies in many cases importers are able to assume the responsibility of pulse distribution inside israel many of them are wholesalers and some of them have grocery outlets with sales of million pulses comprise the largest component of canadas agrifood exports to israel in lentils accounted for of total exports sales of beans and peas were also strong canada is the top global supplier of lentils peas and dried leguminous vegetables to the israeli market and among the top four suppliers

depends largely on imports of oilseeds for crushing in the united states accounted for of soybean imports water shortages may also result in the local industry foregoing production of sunflower seeds and peanuts in years to come relying instead on imports for their needs israels annual crushing capacity of soybeans is approximately tmt the largest soybean crusher in israel is shemen other crushers include tethbeth olivex solbar and milomor domestic crushers are at a disadvantage because kosher restrictions allow them to operate only days per year new crushing facilities in turkey and egypt are also posing a threat to domestic operations although us soybeans have a quality and supply advantage over many foreign suppliers israeli crushers are open to suppliers that can provide the same quality and reliability for service for a lower price canadian exporters are therefore in a good position to compete pet food in israel approximately of households have a dog making them the most commonly owned pet in the country the number of dogs is also expected to rise in the coming years increasing dog food sales cats follow as the secondmost popular house pet at present approximately of israeli households having cats this figure is expected to increase in the coming years as well because of the unstable economy sales of premium foods for dogs and cats will be low throughout the next few years in favour of economy and mediumpriced foods privatelabel pet foods however are expected to see significant growth overall wet dog food is expected to sell approximately million in while dry dog food is expected to be worth million wet cat food is expected to sell million and dry cat food is forecast to reach million in sales of pet care products have been declining over the past few years from million in to million in forecasts estimate that sales in this sector will continue to decline for at least three years or until the economy becomes more stable and consumers are able to spend money on luxury items for their pets sales of dog and cat food from canada have almost doubled since reaching million in canada is now the thirdlargest supplier to the israeli market behind the united states million and italy million the market is poised for future growth and thus offers significant opportunities to canadian companies although nonkosher pet foods sell well in the market kosher brands offer a distinct advantage and will likely provide a huge market in the future prepared foodspackaged foods israeli consumers are looking for products that are quick and easy to prepare and are spending more on food prepared away from home these changes in eating habits have encouraged supermarkets to allocate space for consumerready products which consist of prepared meals and meal components prepared foods also require certificationon a product by product basis or at least on groups of raw materials according to the kosher meat and poultry imports law the meat or poultry component of prepared foods would have to come from an animal that had been slaughtered according to rabbinate of israel exporters should consult with their potential importer or their agent in israel prior to exporting ready meals ready meals are aimed at consumers who work and do not have time to cook these meals are therefore convenient and easy to buy transport prepare and clean up higherearning professionals make up a large portion of readymeal consumers italian is the leading ethnic food in israel as evidenced by the success of pastabased ready meals and most notably pizza which is the topselling ready meal item in the country in frozen pizza accounted for of volume sales and of value sales in the ready meals category it is popular with all age groups and is purchased by families and singles pizza as well as poultry and vegetablebased meals sell for lower prices than red meat fish and pastabased ready meals because of the cost of their ingredients although ready meals are available in several formats chilled and frozen varieties are currently the best sellers and are poised for future growth increased freezer space and the availability of new flavours have led to the growth of frozen ready meals leading domestic producers of frozen ready meals include soglowek nahariya ltd tivall tovav ltd chiby italian food ltd maadanot ltd and hamsi ltd privatelabel ready meals have seen tremendous growth in recent years and accounted for of total segment sales in nevertheless sales of privatelabel ready meals are not slated for huge increases in the coming years due to the premium quality offered by their competitors there could be opportunities for highquality privatelabel ready meals however the ready meals category is a relatively new area that has experienced strong growth in recent years due to busier consumer schedules as is the case with many new categories currently there is a lack of brand loyalty which will provide opportunities for highquality products to distinguish themselves from existing brands additional opportunities for canadian suppliers may also be found in the sale of food ingredients used in the preparation of ready meals condiments israels condiment market is valued at million and is forecast to reach million by ketchup has been the number one condiment since at least the mids and has retained the top spot since tomato pastes purees and sauces salad dressings and mayonnaise offer consistent market growth as do savoury sauces and dry mixes osem the leading domestic condiment producer controls of the market other leading companies are segal strauss and vita imported products account for of the category and include popular brand names such as frenchs heinz hellmanns la choy and paul newman there is tremendous room for growth in this sector in a number of product categories providing ample opportunities for canadian exporters ketchup is forecast to hold almost of sales in tomato pastes and purees

years chocolate spreads have seen the largest growth from sales of million in to million in it is the top overall product in the category followed by honey and jamspreserves demand for nut and yeastbased spreads have also risen steadily in the past five years continued growth in all categories is expected for at least the next four years with sales of million forecast for up from million in ingredients opportunities for canadian suppliers may also be found in the sale of food ingredients since raw materials for israels foodprocessing sector are largely sourced through imports agents actively seek out steady sources of supplies and are willing to pay higher prices for quality merchandise that is readily available products including frozen fruits ingredients for baked goods and ingredients for use in ready meals are in high demand certain products that are sold in their natural state such grains and oilseeds can be certified as kosher even though they were not specifically produced as kosher product for israel these products may require certification as to their kosher origin but since the products do not go through a cooking process the procedure is simpler than for prepared or processed products nevertheless exporters should check with their israeli importer to ensure that all kosher requirements are met private label privatelabel products represent an excellent opportunity for retailers to generate increased profits and distinguish themselves from competitors in privatelabel brands represented of sales for the major supermarkets this figure is expected to double in with the growing demand for privatelabel goods in israel retailers are actively looking for new or unique products in nearly all product categories supersol israels leading supermarket chain

advantages especially in markets so far away from home categories with good prospects for canadian companies include pet food ready meals confectionery and breakfast cereals consumer patterns in the market are changing rapidly annual percapita consumption has increased over the past years from litres to litres approximately of the adult jewish population consumes wine although most of the wine produced and consumed in israel is kosher the majority of imports are nonkosher wines for wine to be considered kosher it requires effort and commitment on the part of the wineries in general only kosher vessels and materials may be used during the manufacturing process and the equipment and wine can only be handled by observant jewish males importing wine to israel is still sort of a niche activity since the majority of supermarkets food chains and pointsofsale insist on the sale of kosher products only nevertheless canadian winesparticularly ice winesare wellplaced to develop a market

plantings of tree fruits in british columbia followed in the wake of movement of settlers into the interior the earliest tree fruits are said to have been grown from seed brought to fort vancouver in scions or seedlings of tree fruits supposedly taken from these early plantings were then established for local use wherever settlements occurred by the s there were plantings of small orchards in the lower fraser valley and the first commercial orchard was said to have been established at lytton further north between and by thomas g earl however due mainly to cold winters this area did not prove itself to be a particularly favourable region for orcharding in the meantime an orchard established in in the similkameen valley by fx richter did do well and from this beginning the industry flourished the okanagan as well was discovered to have a climate favourable to tree fruit production the first apple trees in the okanagan valley were plants by an oblate missionary father pandosy in on the present location of the city of kelowna they were supposed to have orginated directly from trees planted at the oblate mission at mission bc when this first tree was planted the area was semiarid with insufficient rainfall to grow anything but sagebrush and rattlesnakes with the discovery that tree fruits did well in the hot dry climate of the okanagansimilkameen valleys fruit orchards sprang up throughout the area obviously many of these orchards did not survive due to unsuitable climate andor soil conditions but with the introduction of power pumps and open flumes which could be used to direct water from lakes and rushing creeks in the foothills orchards were planted inland along the length of the okanagansimilkameen and kootenay valleys now years later with all of the modern methods for moving water not only inland but also to higher elevations the slopes bordering these valleys have been planted to orchards and vineyards and they now represent a veritable paradise on earth ontario fruit growing in ontario probably commenced with the culture of cherries and peaches in the niagara peninsula records indicate that these two fruits were being harvested at the mouth of the niagara river as early as early mentions of apple propagation in the area come to us from the diary of charles woolverton of grimsby township he mentions that the sale of acres of land to his grandfather john woolverton in was bound by the inclusion of natural apple trees the first mcintosh tree was discovered in at dundela dundas county ontario by john mcintosh the son of scottish immigrants to the united states he immigrated to canada in from new york state and eventually settled on a farm near ottawa he discovered an overgrown orchard on this property and transplanted twenty of the healthiest seedlings to new ground but only one survived this tree produced apples that all his neighbours commented on true to his scottish origins mcintosh tried to capitalize on his new find but it wasnt until when a peddler showed mcintosh techniques of bench grafting that he succeeded in duplicating the famous mcintosh tree however the mcintosh was slow to gain acceptance by growers probably due to its susceptibility to scab by with the new spray techniques becoming available to growers mcintosh rapidly became an important variety today mcintosh are cultivated in nearly every apple growing area of north america quebec even before there were established orchards in several areas of québec most of the trees were seedlings grown from seeds supplied by such countries as united states france england and russia and a majority of these early orchards were located on the slopes of the mountainous region surrounding farnham and abbotsford other important areas were located south of montréal in chateauguay county as well as west of montréal in deux montagnes other fruit growing areas found in the isle of orléans near québec city and in l islet county further north date back to the days of frances presence in québec in bushels of apples were harvested in québec of this crop a large percentage was marketed in montréal mb southwick of st hilaire reported apple trees in that area in an equivalent number was reported in the abbotsford region much of the harvest was marketed in populated centres on the shores of the st lawrence today that same marketing pattern exists with a large majority of the québec crop moving to major urban centres such as montréal and québec city which border the st lawrence river new brunswick fruit cultivation was probably introduced to new brunswick in the th century by early settlers from france who came out to settle acadia nicholas denys was one of these he and his wife came to the new world to manage a string of furtrading posts in northern acadia denys was also expected to bring out colonists unfortunately he had difficulties doing this and as a result he was dispossessed and lost most of his belongings he finally retired with his wife and family to a small farm which he owned near nipisiquit new brunswick here he kept a garden with fruit trees in it he left journals and information on fruit propagation in the area which provided important information for others in the fruit industry to build on new york state still supplied apples to fredericton as late as however the greatest advances in fruit cultivation in the province after this date must be attributed to frances peabody sharp of upper woodstock by he was reported to be growing apple trees and plum trees and was shipping nursery stock all over the continent sharpe was also very interested in apple breeding and developed two varieties the new brunswick apple and crimson beauty which apparently had the fameuse and the new brunswick apple as its parents today the crimson beauty is still grown in many canadian orchards and stands as a monument to one of canadas early horticulturists nova scotia as with the development of fruit culture in other parts of eastern canada fruit growing no doubt was introduced to the area by early settlers and was necessitated by the need for selfsufficiency that would date the beginning of fruit propagation in nova scotia to the early s as with québec fruit growing was a family affair with each homestead having several apple trees in displays of nova scotia fruit at a london england exhibition were widely acclaimed by all who saw them by nova scotia was exporting of its production to the british markets however from to the industry exports to uk went into a decline three things possibly caused this as was the case during world war i little fruit was exported to the uk during the second world war by the time the war was over fruit production and specifically apple production in england and europe had reached significant proportions coupled with this was the shortage of exchange the organization of the european economic community and britains entry into it did little to improve the status of nova scotia in a traditional market the introduction of several processing facilities which take a large percentage of the crop has somewhat served to temper the blow that the industry suffered in losing this market and together with added interest in the potential of apples for processing has served as an incentive for increasing interest in fruit production in the province welcome to canadian apple online agriculture and agrifood canadas site for canadian apple market information agrifood trade service online provides access to international trade and

for the largest percentage of value with followed by apples with and tree fruits with the area of production of berry and tree fruits changed table over the past twenty years with the help of new technology and pruning practices that have allowed producers to increase tree densities yields and therefore production over the last five years the number of tree fruit farms have decreased by after being relatively stable fifteen years before on the other hand the number of berry farms have slightly decreased but by only the last five years the important changes were in acreage berry farms increased their acreage by more than the last five years and more than doubled the last twenty years the berry category blueberries and cranberries have witnessed increased production in response to positive health claims but prices have weakened in the past few years due to oversupply situations and weaker export opportunities grape area continues to expand and has increased over in the last five years driven primarily by the demand for high quality vinifera grapes for wine production in the statistics canada census from to number of acreage devoted to apple production decreased by mainly due to low commodity prices and retail consolidation and in spite of new production practices and better yield per hectare producers are struggling to receive a fair return of their crop being at the end of the supply chain producers want to remain competitive and achieve the goals of environmentally responsible production of safe high quality food for domestic and exports markets table number of

from mt and the fourth consecutive decrease since see table the provinces of ontario and quebec suffered huge loss with recordlow production over the last five years climate conditions and severe competition form other countries are responsible for those decreases the farm gate value of canadian apples from the crop are estimated at million nearly the same as in million and almost as low as the crop million on a provincial basis production in british columbia decreased slightly by from a year earlier to reach mt and remained relatively stable at that level since the crop mcintosh spartan red delicious idared and empire are the major varieties produced mostly in eastern canada british columbia growers have planted a number of newer apple varieties such as gala fuji braeburn jonagold ambrosia and honeycrisp in fact gala should become the most important variety in bc before red delicious new plantings of ambrosia are doubling in size every year and should remain likewise for the next years in response to rising availability grower prices for these newer varieties has moderated significantly in the past couple of years in addition apples continue to compete for limited retail shelf space with other major fruit such as bananas and citrus but also more increasingly from exotic fruits from around the world which are now available on a yearround basis apple juice concentrates from china were imported at a very low price and affected greatly local industry and growers producers had to find alternate options to process their apples ontario had to increase the number bulk

table infohort november standard practices integrated fruit production in march the canadian horticultural council received approval for up to in card funding on december from the canadian adaptation and rural development card fund for the canadian apple industry national integrated fruit production ifp initiative ifp is defined as the economical production of high quality fruit which gives priority to ecologically sound methods and minimizes the use of agricultural chemicals thereby protecting the environment and human health the project is designed to develop national ifp guidelines principles and standards for the canadian apple industry more information is available on the chc website at httpwwwhortcouncilca the chcs apple working group awg will move into the next phase of the initiative and works towards deelopment of national onfarm food safety guidelines for canadian apple growers integrated pest management the apple industry in cooperation with provincial extension specialists and officials at the pest management regulatory agency pmra have developed an integrated pest management ipm strategy ipm is a process that optimizes the use of biological cultural and chemical measures to control pest and disease pressures producers continue to adapt their agricultural management practices to respond to environmental concerns reduce costs of crop protection materials and address pestdisease resistance concerns the framework for the program has also been designed to be transferable to other tree fruit crops ipm is part of the ifp strategy pest management regulatory agency update update on streptomycin and mcp apple growers concerns in relation to product availability in the short term include the antimicrobial streptomycin and a growth regulator type of product recently registered in the us mcp methylcyclopropene the bacterial disease fire blight can affect several types of fruit trees including apple and pear under favourable conditions and without adequate control a fire blight infection can have a serious impact in an orchard one of the few tools available to apple growers for managing this problem is the antibacterial streptomycin the issue of antibiotic resistance in general and the fact that resistance problems have been observed in some orchards have been making the future of this product uncertain however growers are not ready to give up on the use of this product since no other alternatives have been found yet to fill the niche of an efficient antibacterial product for orchard use registration of this product has been renewed for the season when harvested fruits are exposed to the volatile active ingredient mcp they are less susceptible to the influence of the gaseous plant hormone ethylene which is involved in the ripening of fruit ethylene is particularly important in stored apples and that is why apple growers see the new product as having good potential to improve the quality of their produce and to extend apple storage time they are eager to obtain early registration of this product since their us counterparts already have the benefit of using mcp since last year the product mcp has entered the submission process at the pest management regulatory agency following a recent application for registration in canada traceability wwwproducesupplycom traceability addresses how a product can be traced through the supply chain cpma and pma created in november a joint task force to tackle traceability cpmapma traceability task force this group is to produce a best practices document that will

principles the canadian partners in quality cpiq program is being developed as a voluntary alternative to traditional inspection methods for fresh fruit and vegetables under the cpiq program the facility would assume responsibility for documenting and implementing a quality system to ensure that produce quality requirements are met the program will be validated through periodic audits of each facilitys system by cfia auditors the initial cpiq pilot project in in potato packing facilities in the atlantic went well cfia have had discussions with the industry on fees and presented the program to the usda last summer usda visited the pilot participants and cfia is awaiting usda acceptance of the program code of practice for unpasteurized fruit juice a voluntary code of practice for the manufacture of unpasteurized fruit juicecider developed by the cfia in partnership with health canada producer processor distributor and consumer representatives was finalized and distributed in the code sets out recommendations for growing harvesting transporting storing processing packaging and distributing the product its objective is to make all producers aware of the potential problem and inform them of how to avoid the contamination of their juicecider by pathogenic microorganisms such as e coli h global coding to ensure consistency of codes around the world industry worked with the

data pools the emergence of data pools in the industry is present in canada eccnet and the united states uccnet launched in by the electronic commerce council of canada eccc eccnet is designed to centralize data to ensure greater accuracy and also provide costsavings to trading partners the canadian produce industry has come up with its own industry product database ipd the purpose of which is the same as eecnet but structured to meet the specific requirements of produce the industry is now trying to determine which system is going to provide the best solution the best data and the easiest to manage repacking transportation and wholesale food safety project the first edition of these best practices guidelines will be finalized in by cpma also cpma will issue a haccp model for the repacking and wholesale sector including critical control points the model may not apply to all as needs differ cpma involved the canadian council of grocery distributor ccgd in developing and implementing a haccp toolkit for the warehouse operations promotion canadas apple producers supported a national apple promotion in the past two years in conjunction with the five to ten a day

growers namely china washingtons utilized production increased percent compared to the weather reduced crop california michigan new york and pennsylvania decreased total utilized production from the previous year due to poor weather and less bearing acreage higher prices for apples and pears were mainly responsible for the percent increase in the us grower price index for fruit and nuts during the fall of compared with the previous year weather problems such as freezing temperatures and hail reduced the harvest of apples and pears this past fall and together with lower stocks drove grower prices higher for these two commodities fresh apple prices averaged percent higher aside from significant declines in production among eastern and central appleproducing states a late october freeze in washington the nations largest producer of apples has further reduced domestic supplies available for marketing into particularly of the pink lady and fuji varieties hence apple prices are expected to remain strong and increase further through this winter especially as supplies grow seasonally tighter as of december fresh apple holdings in regular and controlled atmosphere storage facilities as reported by the us apple association were down percent from the same period the year before and are the lowest level in more than a decade national agricultural statistics service usda f forecast change from us apple trade apples lead in us fresh fruit exports both in volume and value terms each year the united states ships more than mt billion pounds of apples to markets across the world with

market for the second consecutive year china and the us the two leading world apple producers have witnessed decrease of apple acreage in china government policy encouraged fruit growers to more fruit diversification contributing to reducing the apple acreage in terms of the variety mix there is indication that the importance of red and golden delicious will slowly decrease at the expense of gala and fuji market globalization and increasing competition require good knowledge of the competitive strengths and weaknesses of different producing countries it is also important to monitor trends in consumer preferences in order to plan a future strategy for production distribution and marketing newer varieties that entered the apple market in the s have become so mainstream that their once attractive price premiums have leveled off the canadian apple industry has been facing a number of challenges over the past decade or so including a general decline in producer prices and an increase in north american and world production see table canada must remain competitive in order to survive not only at home but also in foreign markets apples are produced in all major parts of the world and retailers can supply from all those sources as long as those apples meet certain requirements many of those requirements are dictated by consumers and competition in canada consumers have a considerable advantage compared to others around the world as they spend less than of their income on a food basket competition is then fierce canadian producers must then differentiate from other suppliers with unique advantages canada produces approximately mt of apples each year or less than of the world production estimated at mt in table a two regions asia and the european union are the main producers table b chinas apple production increased by fivefold in the last decade alone to more than million mt varieties of apples have also changed since the early s this increase was at the expense of varieties such as red and golden delicious rome and mcintosh that are predominant in canada production is expected to rise by in the world mostly because of china until canada has increased its imports of apple juice concentrate from china and fresh apple imports from countries such as new zealand south africa and chile fao statistics united states and canada only consult fao definitions change over the sector is in the process of addressing issues such as market development research and reduced pesticide usage all of which will benefit producers as an example tariffs for the european community ec are very complex changing every month during the european union eu crop season and differing for each apple variety under the north american free trade agreement nafta trq and tariffs for apples for mexico were eliminated in january tariffs in argentina are and venezuela in addition to these tariffs there can be consumer and other taxes which vary from to in asia there are tariffs of in taiwan in thailand and in indonesia japan still requires apple exports to be fumigated and an inspector to be on site during the fumigation challenges producers will face major challenges in the next decade and these originate from the consumers themselves social pressures and the retailers consumption of apples was a family thing with the typical fathermothertwokids model things have moved from a more single parent and singleperson model consumers are also more educated and conscious of their environment and the way food is produced or processed they want to know more about pesticides food additives and the nutrition value of the food they buy as people are more educated and informed about what they eat they in turn want more convenient prepared and readytoeat food snacking have become increasingly present for those consumers for more than half of century retail consolidation and the impact of fastfood chains and major discounters such as walmart or costco have increased price pressure on growers and changed the consumer habits for good retailers favourised their own private labels at the expense of the manufacturers brands retailers also want some insurance from suppliers that not only the product is of high quality but also safe and traceable category management have become very popular and efficient for both buyers and suppliers to remain competitive the produce industry may have to have to diversify not only in production new varieties but also in new marketing techniques new markets new products processed products consumption over the last years the consumption of fruit fresh only remained relatively unchanged going from kg per capita kpc in to kpc in with people becoming increasingly more health conscious consumption went from fresh to processed and more convenience fruits juices processed and frozen continued improvements in packaging transportation and distribution have all contributed to the increase in per capita consumption of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables the two most favorite fresh fruit of canadians are citrus and bananas table apples are next statistics canada change from to opportunities or challenges liberalization of trade under the wto should help canadian exporters to continue to develop offshore markets canadas shorter growing season reduces opportunities for market expansion into offshore markets strong competition from earlier maturing us crops tends to set the price and generally impacts negatively on growth opportunities implementation of the new ifp guidelines should increase consumer confidence and industry acceptance in canada and abroad ifp guidelines were developed on the basis of international systems such as europes eurepgap favorable media reports on the health benefits of eating fruits and vegetables will continue to encourage future sales with practically no use of pesticides or chemical fertilizers during production the wild blueberry production can be considered as organic and benefit from higher prices future berry production is expected to increase driven by a good demand from secondary processors such as bakeries for use in muffins bagels pies and the dairy sector for use by yogurt manufacturers increased competition from chinese fresh apples in asian markets is expected to increase in coming years and will exert downward pressure on prices continued favorable

with the custom of burying barrels of apples in the ground and covering them with soil and trash however crude this method was it was probably the initial step in storage development and without doubt led to onfarm root cellars as a more sophisticated method of fruit storage although with either of these methods temperature could not be controlled it usually tended to be constant at somewhere above freezing and was suitable for at least delaying if not preventing deterioration of the product stored onfarm root cellars however primitive compared to todays cold storages are still an effective means of storing perishable products if the product is of a reasonable quality beforehand they have also helped to identify the need for better storage techniques in canada got into the cold storage

summerland british columbia and one at the central experimental farm ottawa cold storage apples are chilled to ºc in special chambers since apples continue to live after picking and breathe by using oxygen and giving off carbon dioxide maintenance of the apples at a low temperature slows the respiration and thus retards the ripening process the humidity is also controlled maintenance at around or higher prevents loss of moisture by evaporation by the s research in a new storage technique called controlled atmosphere storage had gained widespread interest interestingly enough controlled atmosphere storage techniques had been examined by several scientists previous to this as early as the s in fact but unfortunately for the industry all this work had gone unnoted or unused this new technique combined airtight refrigeration at ºc with an atmosphere reduced in oxygen and with increased levels of carbon dioxide the resulting effect was that the ripening process slowed to a rate such that the apples could be maintained longer than under normal cold storage the first commercial ca storage was constructed at frelighsburg québec in of vital importance to the storage of apples under these conditions are two things the apples must be of excellent quality and the storage should be closed and sealed as quickly as possible after initial filling begins to achieve the maximum benefits of the technique ca storages are closed under government supervision and must not be opened for at least days after a seal is affixed for the apples to be officially called ca apples with the development of cold storage apples could be marketed for extended periods of time the implications of this technique on the industry were immediate and positive instead of trying to market all his apples during a two month span in the fall the producer was now able to sell fresh apples up until christmas with the introduction of controlled atmosphere storage the marketing season was extended until march and april with further benefits to both growers and consumers the sale of the product over a longer period of time resulted in a more even price distribution over the marketing season the consumer was able to buy fresh canadian apples during many of the winter months previously bereft of local apples a further modification of the controlled atmosphere storage concept simply called low oxygen storage has been researched in recent years canada is a world leader in the research work presently being conducted on the controlled atmosphere storage concept few commercial enterprises have attempted this new storage method because of its increased complexity and cost although the monetary benefits can be easily measured and opportunities for sales of apples in the summer months are identified the technique is still in research stages apples can be stored by the low oxygen technique in chambers used for controlled atmosphere storage but the gases in the chamber must be much more closely monitored under low oxygen storage the equipment needed to do this is also more highly specialized three things are vital when considering low oxygen storage one must be knowledgeable about the subject and prepared to spend both extra time and money on the project the apples which go into such a storage must be of the highest quality and of specific maturity and the apples must be chilled to the appropriate temperature and atmosphere mix as quickly as possible after harvest these three factors cannot guarantee success but can increase the likelihood that the project would reach a positive conclusion present storage situation canadian apple storage holdings by type of storage by region of storage and by variety of apples show that developments in storage have followed the needs of the industry the volume of apples held in ca storage has been gradually increasing over the years as more ca storages are built more and more apples are being held for extended periods apple storage data is collected monthly october to july in each province across canada and reports are made available to the public by the second week of that month through the web site at httpwwwagrcainfohort reports available are apple storage by type province and district provides data by provincial district and storage type controlled atmosphere cold and common apple storage by type variety and utilization provides data by provincial district and intended utilization fresh juice and peeler summary the availability of ca storage at a commercial level has greatly extended the marketing season for apples excellent ca apples now appear on supermarket shelves as late as july of course it is not economic for a grower to store all his apples in ca storage the ideal situation is to have a combination of cold and controlled atmosphere storages keith cummings po box clarksburg on nh j tel fax email kcummingsbmtscom binkely apples ltd bryan fawcettlarry elford rr thornbury on nh

popularity consumers are beginning to perceive fish and seafood as a healthier source of protein compared with alternative meat products this trend is predominantly visible in the younger generation

information introduction the food beverage retail report has been devised as a handbook of practical information for use by canadian agrifood exporters whose preliminary research has identified the singapore market for possible penetration whether solely within the country or as a strategy into the region this document has been created as an update of the original report carried out by the canadian high commission of singapore and published in january the objective is to provide an updated and qualified list of active companies who have indicated interest in importing and distributing canadian agrifood products for the retail market all companies listed within this report have responded to a retail survey conducted through the commercial section of the canadian high commission in singapore the survey was conducted over a period of three weeks in december data was derived from the surveys predominantly closeended question additional information on the specific product group

general business climate in singapore as well as background information related to the retail food beverage industry profiles of the leading supermarkets as well as recent changes and developments in

singapore and various authorities within singapore the canadian high commission in singapore hopes that this report will assist canadian agrifood exporters to more accurately target their product offerings and speed potential business connections within singapore companies who are interested in pursuing businesses listed in this report are encouraged to use the contact information provided in the index for each of these companies the singapore market singapore an island citystate located at the tip of peninsular malaysia in the heart of southeast asia has an area of about km² in spite of

makes the islandstate a safe bet for continued international business regional singapore has been historically recognized as southeast asias distribution hub and has been the base of operations for many food and beverage importers and exporters providing administrative and financial support for business establishments in other countries in the region this role however may be daunted in the future by the additional infrastructure being completed around southeast asia shipping destinations at johor bahru and port klang in malaysia will challenge the countrys ability to maintain its part as a transshipment point for the region however singapores longstanding ability to facilitate around the region tapping on computer and communications technology incentives and financial support should retain its title as a vibrant entrance and distribution point for international business notwithstanding the repercussions of the asian economic crisis singapore has continued to pursue liberal trade and investment policies and to deepen internal reform especially in key services a new wto report on singapores trade policies says that singapore has weathered the recent economic crisis in the region well mainly due to its stable and sound macroeconomic policies and its open trade and investment regime world trade organization press release march the retail sector grocery trade description singapore continues to be considered one of the most developed food retail markets in southeast asia with high disposable income the monthly per capita food expenditure is s based on the most recent singapore statistics household expenditure survey this amount comprises an average monthly per capita expenditure of s and s on noncooked and cooked food respectively due to the dearth of agricultural land on the island singaporeans are more dependent on imported food and beverage resulting in higher expenditure on food products compared to neighbouring countries catering primarily to household consumption the grocery trade can be generally divided into three main categories of marketing channels and distribution provision shops are nofrills small stores usually set up in highly populated residential areas to cater specifically to those block areas they are usually family run and staffed minimarts offer a slightly broader range of products in a more comfortable setting which increasingly includes some air conditioning supermarkets added together by statistics singapore as supermarkets and departmental stores cum supermarkets provide an extensive selection of products and tend to offer higher end products in the mix within an airconditioned environment there are some general trends that have occurred from this is due to the reduced number of general provision shops and the increased number of both minimarts and supermarkets while these two latter categories have more than doubled their numbers since the number of provision shops has plummeted number of stores in grocery trade there may be several reasons for this shift economic growth and generally higher incomes have enabled individuals to shop in establishments with greater selection and comfort the shift from provision shop to minimart seems to also hold advantages for small entrepreneurs in that these minimarts are often franchised and provide the owner with better management systems stock control and more effective purchasing power for those with good business savvy existing provision shops have been upgrading to minimarts with the emergence of both national and international supermarket chains which tend to be more aggressive in their marketing strategies the number of stores has risen from in to about in these establishments also provide a much higher level of employment as they have expanded compared to provision shops or minimarts as the supermarkets continue to consolidate and increase their buying power they will become an even greater force in singapore even after the tough economic climate of the late s the grocery trade has grown from to turnover increased at about per cent annually supporting the growing population and the increased demand for grocery products amongst consumers turnover by store format supermarkets recorded the highest growth especially between and some factors that have supported the trend towards supermarket shopping are that supermarkets have been moving into the heartlands of residential housing for increased access individuals are also becoming more affluent and savvy to a wider variety of foods and grocery products thus demanding a wider range of goods finally the number of working women continues to increase this group tends to prefer shopping in supermarkets for convenience atmosphere and value for money it looks as though these trends will continue to make supermarket shopping a preferred although not exclusive choice for singaporean grocery shoppers in the future even within the category of supermarket there has been

to singapore canadian opportunities trends and constraints generally the singapore market is a good one to enter into for canadian agrifood producers there is an affluent and expanding market within the country and many of the singaporean importers and exporters of products are interested in taking advantage of their regional hub position to expand into southeast asia and beyond singapore however is extremely price conscious with the increasingly savvy population innovative and valueadded products are in higher demand but with a cost sensitivity that should be noted agrifood products imported into singapore must conform to regulatory requirements health certificates and supporting documentation are needed for meat poultry and seafood items canada and singapore have agreed to specific import regulatory requirements for most meat imports including bison however other exotic meats currently do not have agreements in place the issue of halal products those that are handled and processed within the requirements of the muslim community is becoming increasingly important for widespread acceptance in singapore many importers and questioning the viability of nonhalal certified food and beverage products in this country and region major agrifood sources to singapore include australia new zealand malaysia indonesia and some of the european countries their perceived proximity compared to north america and especially canada gives them an advantage of being top of mind more often than not proximity is associated with lower cost and increased freshness based on the interviews conducted for this survey canada can take advantage of its exchange rate to differentiate itself from the united states canada seems recognized as a high quality producer of food and beverage products but may need to take advantage of goods that have added value as opposed to commodity level products however with the question of safe supplies of products and specifically in meats secondary sourcing may be a valuable opportunity for canada comments from some of the companies interviewed suggested that healthy was an increasing buzzword in singapore organic health fresh it was also indicated that convenience foods frozen goods that can be place in chillers and are ready to serve from meals to desserts are in increasing demand both for retail customers as well as food services adding to the convenience trend petrol gas station grocery outlets are becoming increasingly popular for basic goods confectionery products and readytoserve items canadas reputation as a solid supplier needs to be backed with a willingness to build a relationship with singapore importers with the size of the singapore market remaining small the need for consolidators or the facilitation of smaller orders will

access exporters of agrifood products to malaysia face a number of challenges when entering the market the market for imported foods continues to be liberalized as tariffs are reduced for most products luxury goods are heavily taxed while goods such as raw materials essential foodstuffs and pharmaceutical products are subject to reduced duties many other goods which are to be used in malaysia’s development also benefit from lower duties although tariffs have been reduced on a number of goods certain sectors still have high rates in order to regulate imports certification requirements imported meat products must be from approved halal facilities because the products cannot be sold to muslims in malaysia unless they are certified halal imports from china also require special permits if a specific license is not required a declaration of goods imported form must be filled out at the point of import documentation is generally handled by international freight

capabilities malaysia needs to increase the competitive capabilities of food production within the country however the agricultural sector faces challenges such as acute labour shortages limited availability of suitable land and increasing cost of production competition for resources from other sectors and competition in the global market has contributed to these challenges strong local

diminishing role in malaysia’s economy over sq km of land is irrigated malaise’ primary agricultural products include from other sectors and expand into new areas while maintaining the ability to conserve and utilize natural resources the specific objectives of the nap are to enhance food security to increase productivity and competitiveness of the sector to deepen linkages with other sectors to create new sources of growth for the sector and to conserve and utilize natural resources on a sustainable basis initiatives to promote new products and emerging industries such as agroforestry biotechnology products specialty natural products bamboo and rattan floriculture and aquarium fish are expected to be sources of growth for the agricultural sector although land expansion is not likely to occur productivity is expected to increase during the nap period due to increased labour productivity this will reflect the emphasis put on labour saving technology innovations and more efficient farm management practices as well moderate expansion of land will still be pursued in some areas such as agroforestry oil palm and fruit and vegetable cultivation this will require key elements of the country’s economic foundation such as human resources technology physical infrastructure finance and incentives and supporting industries and institutions to be continuously developed

accuracy and reliability of the information this report is intended as a concise overview of the market for those interested in its potential and is not intended to provide indepth analysis which may be required by the individual exporter executive summary asean association of southeast asian nations is a regional group that has over the last two decades become more interested in increased economic integration between its members asean members are a highly heterogeneous group with political structures ranging from democracies to military dictatorships and certain development rivalling that of western europe coupled with some of the poorest countries in the world even though the overall region is relatively poor strong real gdp growth both recorded and forecast make this an interesting and potentially lucrative market canadian agrifood and seafood exports to asean are small and confined to only a few products wheat and soybeans being the most important in exports were valued at million trade and domestic economic liberalization coupled with rising incomes makes asean a potential growth market for canadian goods history and future of asean asean was created in by five member states – indonesia malaysia philippines singapore and thailand initially as a mechanism to protect against a perceived communist threat within the region it has since expanded to include brunei cambodia laos myanmar and viet nam and has arguably become the most successful economic association primarily involving developing countries much of the group’s initial dialogue consisted of noneconomic issues such as regional stability and peace starting in there was a dramatic shift to better address common economic concerns one of the most important principles agreed upon was the establishment of an asean free trade agreement afta the afta formalized in requires that the first six member countries register most product classifications as part of their inclusion list il the items in their inclusion lists were then proscribed to fall to tariff levels between zero and five per cent with per cent at zero as of per cent were in this range asean secretariat the direction of asean’s economic focus is oriented towards greater trade liberalization it is optimistically scheduled that there will be zero tariffs on all intraasean trade by and a single market for goods services and investments by agriculture has been identified as one of the priority markets that requires added attention in the integration process because of increased linkages between the regions and a confluence of domestic regulations asean members have also indicated interest in branding asean using methods such as made in asean labelling similar to the beginnings of the european union asean is increasing presenting a common front in bilateral trade negotiations talks have started with both china and india and asean members are optimistic that free trade areas with these countries can be negotiated and completed by and respectively the asean economy unlike many other regional associations asean did not form out of thenpresent common political ideologies or economic circumstances the only common factor that linked them was geographical proximity although the countries remain at highly different levels of development it is their newfound common outlook for the economic development of the region that joins them population population growth asean seeks to fasttrack economic integration afp jan other measures of development such as international aid per capita reveal similar heterogeneity between countries as with incomes net fdi flows on the other hand are less varied between countries and in all cases but one are positive inflows their levels are low relative to world levels especially when compared against other stable developing countries within the last decade all the countries have rapidly increased production of agricultural products see table livestock production has outpaced overall food production in the entire region an indication that local producers are responding to increased domestic demand for highvalue products resulting from rising incomes land productivity as measured by cereal yield for example is relatively consistent among asean physical capital is much larger in the eu as they record tractors per thousand hectares in comparison to the asean average of eight given these large resource bases for european agriculture with similar levels of inputs asean farmers would probably be able to easily increase production with rising wealth these inputs should become more accessible to the average farmer fao statistics world development indicators world bank arable land is in millions of hectares in food production index in is such that livestock production index in is such that cereal yield is in kilograms per hectare fertilizer use is tonnes per thousand hectares of arable land in and tractor use is tractors per thousand hectares other asean members accounted for over per cent of import demand as mentioned before exports are small in comparison to brunei’s imports in agrifood exports valued million usd and imports million usd the largest category of imports was cereals some of the smaller categories in which it was a large importer were bakery products beer cigarettes and fruits world trade atlas canadian exports to this tiny country are very small amounting to only a few hundred thousand dollars annually table describes the various commodities exported although recent trends suggest that canada has done well in brunei exports in exceeded plantations have been encouraged and are focused on palm oil cashews coffee tea and vegetables other important commodities were alcoholic beverages malt extract and milk products in that year like many others canada did not export any agrifood and seafood products to cambodia and thereby had no market presence table canadian agrifood and seafood exports to cambodia total agrifood exports cookies source canadian agrifood and seafood exports to cambodia were nonexistent from to in exports were minimal as seen in table indonesia like many of the other asean countries indonesia has experienced a shaky foundation in the last fifteen years with both economic and political disturbances in primary crops indonesia is highly engaged in the production of rice sugar coconuts and corn after chicken the secondlargest type of meat is surprisingly pork which accounts for more than a quarter of meat production most of the pork however is exported to singapore australia per cent the united states per cent china per cent india per cent and thailand per cent overall indonesia’s main imports are basic commodities table outlines its main agrifood and seafood imports much the same reason exists for cotton and oilseeds canadian exports to indonesia are almost exclusively focused on cereals table canadian agrifood and seafood exports to indonesia total agrifood exports wheat and meslin nondurum potatoes frozen prepared skim milk powder flour meal pellets not edible wheat durum source canada supplied per cent of indonesia’s import demand of nondurum wheat in in canada’s exports fell considerably valueadded products on the other hand have shown continued growth in this market for example the export of frozen potatoes many of which are used in french fries is a large growth market laos laos much like cambodia and myanmar is extremely poor overseas development aid makes up more than per cent of gdp because of widespread subsistence farming and lack of a highly developed export sector laos was relatively unaffected by the asian crisis of the late s it has enjoyed high real growth rates for the past few years and is projected to continue doing so primary crop production is almost exclusively focused on rice while pork dominates meat production like viet nam laos does not produce its own trade data and as such are derived through indirect means laos imported million usd worth of agricultural products in the largest sector by value was beverages and tobacco followed by cereals and related preparations canadian agrifood and seafood exports to laos total agrifood exports source as seen in table canadian agrifood and seafood exports to laos simply do not exist the last recorded export in this category was in in no exports of any sort flowed between canada and laos it has been projected that the country will be a net oil importer by the end of the decade but that its large gas deposits will continue to provide significant revenues domestic meat production is dominated by chicken on the whole malaysia is a net agrifood exporter as values reveal that imports were billion usd and exports were billion usd table below outlines the broad import categories of malaysia malaysia imports a wide variety of agrifood and seafood products which has resulted from its higher income and thereby more differentiated tastes of its citizens value is in millions of american dollars the two countries that border malaysia play significant roles in its trade patterns thailand per cent china per cent australia per cent indonesia per cent and the united states per cent although the world exports a wide variety of products to malaysia canada’s exports are concentrated in two products soybeans and wheat myanmar myanmar is the poorest of the asean members and one of the poorest in the world its government is run by the military and there are international concerns over human rights as such international corporations are reticent to enter the market because of the resulting negative perception domestically agriculture accounts for a significant portion of both the economy and the labour force and per cent respectively this is despite widespread hunger within the country domestic primary crop production is focused on rice in which output increased per cent between and prior to myanmar was a net agrifood importer but since that time it has become a net exporter its largest exports are fruits and vegetables similarly seen in many other poor countries the leading broad import group is beverages and tobacco canadian agrifood and seafood exports to myanmar total agrifood exports mackerel fresh herrings frozen source value is in canadian dollars for the last decade export values have never really reached above the value although the philippines was more insulated during the asian crisis of the late s than its neighbours they also had not so fully participated in the large international capital inflows over the last few years the philippines has recorded the lowest real per capita gdp growth of any asean member to boost the economy the government has undertaken a major initiative to increase infrastructure and reform the tax system in the lives of everyday people agriculture still plays a large role as more than per cent of the labour force is engaged in this sector contributing per cent of gdp world trade atlas its exports were mostly primary goods such as bananas and coconut oil imports as outlined in table were a varied group consisting mainly of goods that are not wellsuited to the philippine climate before tobacco exports had been practically nonexistent overall canadian agrifood and seafood exports to this market have done extremely well considering that mid values averaged slightly over million singapore singapore is a small highly open economy that has achieved significant wealth gdp per capita is now on par with many western industrialized countries singapore has one of the world’s most open tradefriendly economies resulting from its high population density and the resulting lack of natural resources singapore is home to the headquarters of over multinational corporations and is a regional leader in exporting electronics singapore is a large net agrifood and seafood importer although this number is somewhat undervalued because of the significant impact of reexports the largest exports were high value goods such as beverages and tobacco products as for imports table outlines the leading categories value is in millions of american dollars singapore does not record trade between itself and indonesia it should be noted that singapore data do not include trade with indonesia above in table are canada’s leading exports to singapore although not listed above one major growth product has been the export of cured bacon this has seen annual growth of almost ten percent in just under million was exported thailand thailand has enjoyed rapid economic growth brought about by a wide industrial base that initially started in valueadded agricultural goods that has since diversified a major component of the economy is tourism which is seen as a cheap and exotic destination by young people the country’s open attitude to business coupled with ongoing reforms of the fragile banking sector should make the country extremely conducive to further investment this is confirmed by the fact that per cent of the labour force is engaged in agriculture but the sector only contributes per cent to gdp thailand’s main production of primary crops is centered on sugar thailand is considered the world’s largest exporter in the government proposed increased subsidies to farmers and some debt relief to date however no action has been taken other important primary crops include rice cassava and rubber because of its abundant natural resources thailand has emerged as a large net agrifood and seafood exporter in exports were valued at billion usd and imports at billion usd leaving a trade surplus of almost billion usd thai imports see table are interesting considering that a significant portion is comprised of seafood products half of which is various types of frozen tuna one area that has seen considerable growth is oilseeds which is almost completely fuelled by demand for soybeans value is in millions of american dollars canada’s share in this market was per cent value is in millions of canadian dollars canadian trade with thailand was down in over previous years substantially because of lessened wheat exports the export of crabs and shrimp constitute more than per cent of canada’s trade with thailand viet nam viet nam is ruled by a oneparty communist state has moved recently to adopt freer market policies in july the first stock market in viet nam was opened the world trade organization hopes that viet nam will accede on schedule in but significant additional reforms still need to be undertaken the reforms that have been enacted so far have undoubtedly helped the country achieve the highest real gdp per capita growth rate in the region much like thailand rural poverty is rampant and relies primarily on subsistence farming leading exports to viet nam by canada are almost identical in composition as those to thailand with a liberalizing economy a larger population and faster economic growth than thailand agrifood and seafood exports to viet nam could see large gains there are a couple of interesting points first the trends in overall trade versus agrifood trade are completely opposite in total trade relative imports are rising while relative exports remain constant while in agrifood trade the opposite is true second intraasean trade is rising more quickly for agrifood and seafood products than for overall trade this may be an indicator that tariffreducing exercises are increasing regional trade flows as tariffs and nontariff barriers are usually higher on agricultural products than other commodity classifications direction of asean trade flows overall intraasean imports intraasean exports intraasean total agrifood seafood intraasean imports intraasean exports intraasean total source asean secretariat these numbers are the combined imports and exports reported by six asean members brunei indonesia malaysia philippines singapore and thailand to the thencurrent asean members thus there is upward bias in the numbers as the date progresses also agrifood and seafood is defined simply as the first hs chapters because of common linkages such as former colonial bonds and similar organizational frameworks a greater partnership between asean and the eu may have been expected today however asean is looking increasing westward as the member countries have realized their overall heavy dependence on japanese goods and technology and would like to see greater diversification of external suppliers for total merchandise total value bil bil exports the asean region has share been a declining region both agrifood value bil bil in nominal and relative terms share as displayed in table asean is a larger market for canadian agrifood and seafood exports than for any single european nation edward elgar cheltenham uk canada’s largest exports to the region are outlined in table half of trade with the region is composed of wheat the other leading products are similarly unprocessed products with little valueadded much of this can simply be attributed to low incomes and therefore low demand for highvalue products as the region develops however there should be increased demand for more canadian agrifood and seafood products especially highvalue ones agrifood past present future report philippines january philippines country report philippines past

years having experienced recessions eg most recently the asian financial crisis and implemented numerous economyboosting laws and reforms the country has recently made considerable progress in establishing economic stability although fiscal and social problems remain two of the philippines’ largest weaknesses in order to see sustained economic growth the filipino government must implement a highgrowth strategy to address the country’s poverty issue a high population growth rate and unequal distribution of wealth throughout the country are major contributing factors to the philippines’ ongoing struggle with poverty in fact the national capital region ncr situated in manila alone is home to of the population and generates onethird of total gdp furthermore per capita income in the ncr was estimated at almost nine times that of the poorest region of the philippines other challenges remain including widespread corruption little progress with core fiscal policies the need for legal reforms and rising energy prices however the state plans to introduce continued economic reforms in order to help the philippines remain competitive with the rest of developing asia the government’s strategy includes improving infrastructure boosting public revenues by strengthening tax collection tightening fiscal spending fostering privatization improving banking sector viability and increasing

average in and down from in as filipinos increasingly lead busier lifestyles demand for healthier packaged and processed foods is greatly increasing filipinos also enjoy dining outside of the home on a regular basis often frequenting takeaway and fast food outlets as well as reasonably priced fullservice restaurants with family therefore major opportunities for canadian agrifood exporters may include offering healthier portable convenience and readytoeat and cook foods as is the case in many countries traditional eating habits are modified as cultural and social changes surface with the philippines having seen an influx of westernstyle fast food chains and products bolstered by western lifestyles shown through media consumers have trended toward purchasing more meals from such outlets and moving away from eating traditional filipino dishes healthier packaged and readytoeat foods such as breakfast cereals pasta margarine and spreads have become increasingly popular consumer expenditure totalled billion in and is expected to rise approximately to reach billion by overall spending on less nutritious processed and packaged foods seems to be decreasing as consumers opt for healthier and more affordable valueadded options specific agrifood products that hold strong opportunities in the philippines marketplace include powdered milk green peas fresh or dried potatoes and potato flakes or powder tomato paste or purée and fresh dried and mixed fruit flavouring for ice cream snack canned and beverage products dressings and spreads cocoabased products and fats and oils

other key competitors include australia china and european union eu countries access issues the philippines remains a destination of constant trade and investment interest for foreign investors and holds strong potential for canadian companies wanting to penetrate the southeast asian market to facilitate successful market entry canadian exporters are encouraged to develop market entry strategies that include working with local importers and distributors to develop a presence gain valuable market advice and best position products to meet local tastes laws and pricing logistics are a key consideration when looking to export to the philippines although the country continues to improve its infrastructure many distribution networks specifically roads in and around manila remain underdeveloped or highly congested the majority of the philippines’ requirements governing imports are coordinated with wto regulations while others are specific to the region the philippines does hold several import regulations which canadian exporters should be aware of before entering the market • imported products typically face lower tariffs than those that compete with domestically produced goods the value added tax vat laws were amended in increasing the vat rate to from and reducing vat exemptions in order to raise government revenues and in turn eliminate the fiscal deficit

its transition towards a market based economy its economic performance has been remarkable over the past years vietnam’s growth has been second only to china in the asian region and many believe that growth could match or exceed china’s if infrastructure development and privatization keep up with economic expansion gdp growth is trickling down to the average consumer as average spending power has increased substantially urban consumers have much higher levels of income and are increasingly looking to new retail outlets for new products that meet their evolving lifestyle increasingly vietnam is turning to imports to address the growing needs of its ever expanding consumer base canada vietnam relations canada vietnamese relations have been expanding considerably since diplomatic relations were formally established in since the canadavietnam relationship has developed greatly due in part to a series of high level diplomatic missions by both countries this expanding relationship has led to significant increases in bilateral trade facilitated by a bilateral trade agreement implemented in an agreement on the avoidance of double taxation and an economic cooperation agreement additionally vietnam and canada are both members of la francophonie which has allowed leaders from both countries to conduct less formal yet fruitful meetings since bilateral trade between canada and vietnam increased from roughly million to reach over million in trade balance million • canada’s imports from vietnam were valued at million in canada vietnam ag trade up from million in exports million imports million and million trade balance million • canada’s imports were comprised of primarily fish and seafood cashew nuts coffee wooden furniture garments footwear woven apparel spices coffee and tea agricultural trade traditionally vietnam had been a difficult agricultural market to access due to strict import regulations and high duties and tariffs however this import situation particularly involving agricultural goods could improve to the benefit of imported consumer goods vietnam is poised to join the wto as early as the end of in order to gain membership vietnam has already agreed to remove all agricultural export subsidies implement a reduction in tariffs over a fiveyear period and put an end to all export subsidies the key staples of the vietnamese diet fish and rice are produced in abundance domestically and have naturally limited agricultural imports in the past however the makeup of agricultural imports is changing as more affluent urban consumers seek more variety and convenience options in turn the processing sector is looking to imports to supply this rapidly expanding industry in vietnam imported us billion worth of agricultural goods vietnam’s primary agricultural import suppliers include china australia thailand new zealand asean countries argentina the eu and the us key agricultural imports for the consumer sector include dairy tobacco and grain wheat while other major agricultural imports such as fertilizer animal feed and pesticides support vietnam’s significant agricultural sector this was an increase of more than us million over levels actual import totals continue to be difficult to accurately list as border and reporting issues continue despite impressive growth in consumerready imports bulk commodities continue to dominate the vietnamese agricultural import market a trend that will likely continue over the next five years due to three key factors • first high value and processed goods are in very low demand throughout the country there are niche markets present particularly in the country’s two key cities but a majority of the population is still unable to afford processed or imported goods • second the government is working very hard to build a viable modern food processing sector able to process the country’s vast agresources and imported bulk items for the domestic and regional market given the country’s success in other ventures of this nature it is fully expected that the it will succeed vietnam country report finally despite significant growth and expansion in the retail sector vietnamese food purchases continue to be made in outdoor informal wet markets canada vietnam agricultural trade bilateral agricultural trade between vietnam and canada was valued at million over of total trade this was an increase of million over and million over levels canada exported million worth of agricultural goods in an increase of million over figures canada’s agricultural exports are typically dominated by wheat and export growth was bolstered by a million increase in wheat exports this increase has been carried through as wheat exports through august have already exceeded million growth in also came from significant increases in hide and skin exports which grew by more than million over and seafood exports which increased by almost million over the same period vietnam country report rates for and exceeded and and projections are in line with the period as a whole at and respectively much of the country’s growth has come thanks to a rapidly expanding export sector export growth since has exceeded china’s and vietnam is now challenging even the most dominant countries in their bread and butter exports such as with brazil and coffee india and tea and thailand and rice the truly remarkable aspect of this growth is the trickle down to the general population while vietnam is still one of the asia’s poorest countries gdp ppp has tripled since the percentage of the population that lives in deep poverty less than us per day according to the world bank has dropped from of the population in to less than to date secondary school enrollment has doubled during the same period and today over of appropriate aged children are enrolled in secondary school life expectancy has jumped and infant mortality has plunged statistics like these have demonstrated that over years vietnam has passed india china and the philippines in terms of percentages of population living out of poverty the country has better life expectancy and infant mortality rates than much richer countries like thailand and school enrollment is better than all of the above the vietnamese economy has a number of notable strengths such as key natural resources including oil reserves and an expanding educated

been introduced to some of the larger local supermarkets alcohol sales in particular beer are growing rapidly vietnam has been described as a snackhappy society since imported snacks are subject to some of the highest import rates western producers are moving toward domestic production to meet consumer needs and introduce new brands and products consumer confidence in western products is high

slaughter line andmeat processing equipmentreport vietnam june prepared by thebooth lechay associates ltd hanoiand thecanadian trade commissioner service© department of foreign affairs and international trade executive summary the following report is an analysis of the demand for slaughter line and meat processing equipment in vietnam as well upstream supply lines from feed to farms are moving from household production to an agroindustrial model with corresponding increases in efficiency interviews with executives in the red river delta and the mekong delta regions revealed that current and planned equipment investments are estimated at approximately million usd million this investment only includes interviewed firms indicating that the market is in fact much larger the demand for equipment ranges is split between smaller lower volume equipment and turnkey facilities to fully and semiautomated subproduction lines slaughter line to valueadded processing there is also strong demand for packaging equipment most interviewed firms have clearly defined growth plans largely based on internal capital resources or substantial equity with financing it remains to be determined if these plans are going to be effective especially to meet international production standards nevertheless the new industry catchwords are standards and hygiene some of this is focused on interest in overseas markets with phytosanitary standards rather than on vietnams market this significant investment is in response to the limited production capacity of slaughter line and meat processing firms and the rising consumption of fresh meat and processed meat products the background to these investment plans is the increase in the consumption of meat in from kg to kg per capitayear from to recent estimates place current consumption at kg per capitayear government forecasts estimate consumption will rise to kg by this significant potential demand should be qualified by the fact that questionable statistical gathering methods in vietnam and the necessity for a conservative reading of the market nevertheless rising retail prices for pork are indicative of the growing demand government policies strongly encourage investment in agroprocessing technology with access to subsidized loans or loan guarantees the specific investment outlays have yet to be determined for this program although interviewed executives stated that access to this investment capital will be competitive and based on market principles these policies are also supported by pork export incentive programs furthermore vietnamese firms will face domestic competitive pressure in when the asean free trade agreement enters into force and import taxes on processed meat products falls from to a stable competitive equipment market with defined firm market share has not yet developed nevertheless competition is increasing and gaining a foothold in the market will require determined efforts on the part of canadian slaughter line and meat processing equipment manufacturers regional and international firms who have already entered this market are now focusing on consolidation of existing markets and expansion to take advantage of the significant opportunities market overview introduction emerging market demand the meat processing sector primarily pork is entering a period that can be characterized as an emerging market firms are beginning to make substantial investments in production technology the growth in domestic consumption markets and expanding export markets have reached a level that calls for more substantial capital investment mechanized processing equipment is nonexistent primarily manual slaughtering or not reliable nor efficient and production subprocesses are not efficiently engineered initial investments in the late s for freezer lines and a few standalone machines such as dehairing are worn out or of low production capacity more importantly most firms are undergoing a transition from manual to mechanized production the focus of the majority of interviewed executives is to improve slaughter line production standards and consolidate current markets and to further expand into valueadded meat products sausages and cooked meats and other types of meat processing chicken and beef there is awareness that entire production processes need to be reengineered focusing on key hygiene requirements demand is high for international standard production equipment and food technology engineering complete with service and maintenance this demand for quality and service is in response to the poor performance of foreign rebuilt or inexpensive equipment purchased during the early to mids the ongoing expansion of retail outlets supermarkets and fast food franchises are also fueling the demand for processed meats as well consumption of local food products is growing with the surge of foreign tourism arrivals industry executives are getting to know the most important factors for accessing export markets most firms are aware of the necessity to strive towards international standards and significantly improve production processes standards and hygiene are becoming the new industry catchwords growth in exports continues to be limited by the lack of stable veterinary treaties or other agreements that act as barriers for exports russia is the only country having full veterinary treaty status with vietnam canada has recently agreed on veterinary certificates for nine meat and livestock products but the focus of these agreements was more to secure access to canadian genetic material rather than to establish market access for vietnamese products in the canadian market a much longerterm proposition specific growth plans of vietnamese companies most local companies have clearly defined growth plans largely based on internal capital resources or substantial equity with financing considering these companies current revenues as well as the very low cost of production capital is available for investing in equipment overview the structure of the meat processing sector structure according to industry analysts there are approximately slaughterhouses in vietnam the majority of these firms are present or former state companies and many of these firms are not market competitive a significant number of these firms are perishing or are likely to perish as more efficient firms responding to market forces overtake take their present minor market share and state subsidies become less available due to competitive market forces for investment capital regulatory standards have yet to influence the structure of this sector the competitive meat processing industry can be divided into four levels based on volume of production management sophistication and relative geographic coverage and span a first level is made of three major stateowned integrated firms • ha long canned foods joint stock listed company and these companies own a combination of slaughterhouses processing plants and refrigeration facilities in ho chi minh city hcmc danang and haiphong the latter only for ha long canned foods vissan is the only company that is fully integrated from feedlots to retail outlets it has been stated that animex plants are of the few plants in vietnam that comply with international hygiene standards only three of the total in vietnam meet international standards although this could not be verified during the field research activities these three firms employ upwards of employees each markets are both domestic and export production at each is above tonnes per year the second level of companies is made up of firms producing between and tonnes per year the third level is made up of approximately to slaughterhouse and meat processing firms these firms are predominantly focused on slaughter and freeze and more recently pig farming to lock in supply lines downstream value added is just beginning such as cooked and sliced pork for the retail market these companies are concentrated in • the city of haiphong and the surrounding red river delta provinces and • hcmc and surrounding region these firms employ on average between and employees an important factor to note is that according to industry executives there are more firms than are widely known but these firms operate as trading companies these second tier firms produce from to tonnes per year for both the domestic especially wholesale and export markets according to industry analysts the firms in the fourth tier number in the hundreds these firms are involved in a much broader range of activities from slaughtering to valueadded production such as processed and fresh cooked meats for almost exclusively local markets the city of haiphong alone was stated as having over small companies involved in these activities these firms are best characterized as family businesses most of these firms produce well below tonnes per year while valueadded processing firms produce less than tonnes per year meat processing equipment lines according to factory research and inspection mechanized slaughter line meat processing equipment is evident in the stages of production noted below it should be noted that the majority of this equipment is old of low productivity and in need of upgrading with the exception of new meat processing firms catering to the high income market the majority of these firms production processes or equipment do not meet international equipment standards for certification the following table is

there is significant demand for slaughter line and meat processing equipment as well as well as the capital to pay for it improved technology is the key to overcoming the current constraints currently the industry is characterized as being unhygienic from animal slaughtering to meat processing and the meat distribution system these executives are also getting to know the correct equation for the growth and development of their firms and general opportunities and challenges in the sector blca field interview future processing equipment growth specific investment projects are divided to the scale of production with the exception of vissan most investment focuses on semimechanization these range from fullscale turnkey packages to single item units such as a small sausage machine the growth is divided between scale and production processes big scale turnkey packages for factory production • modest investment of million usd million to large multiplant investments of million usd million • there is the significant potential for turnkey packages the market for this equipment is limited to the top tier producers medium to small scale production subprocess equipment medium to smallscale production processes are primarily targeted at firms producing upwards of tonnes per year these companies are characterized by a relative lack of awareness in available technology although capital is not regarded as an impediment this reflects the market as being early stage as well as the limited numbers of technical exchanges following vietnams diplomatic isolation the us embargo only being lifted in former reliance on east bloc technology and former lack of resources the following equipment is needed • kill floor equipment potential co or stunning equipment mechanical moving equipment • mechanical dehairing machinery scalding wash and animal preparation equipment hygiene prior to slaughtering • conveyors and cutting line technology • secondary processing technology such as grinders mixers blenders and moving equipment • hygiene and safety systems • value added processes such as smokehouse technology sausage making machines and others • chicken and beef processing equipment small scale standalone equipment there is a broad demand for smallscale standalone equipment the critical factor for demand for this equipment is the price level for different production processes stated needs are for small cutters grinders and mixers sausage making machinery and other processed meats this market is very difficult to aggregate with accuracy to determine the demand for equipment would clearly require more comprehensive equipment and market research specific investment projects due to the brevity of analysis not all firms investment plans are listed given the general demand in the industry most firms are currently looking at new equipment or will be in the near future interviewed firm executives stated the following list company investment potential usd equipment haiphong food processing million expand production to include beef slaughter and processing improve existing slaughter line technology expand to value added production with a capacity of to tonsday pressing investment concern background to the demand for meat processing equipment domestic consumption demand increasing economic prosperity in vietnam has a direct relationship to the growth in food consumption and correspondingly demands for meat processing average annual meat consumption per capita increased approximately from kg to kg from to accurate and unbiased statistics are notoriously difficult to obtain in vietnam almost certainly the consumption rates have been increasing by per annum since then the share of commercial feed consumption has increased from to in the same period of time the demand for commercial feed is increasing while prices are falling an important indicator that markets are becoming more efficient foreign investment has been coming into this sector and this growth in animal feed is anticipated to continue as current demand is approximately million tonsyear while supply is limited to only million tonsyear danish embassy increasing supply of meat especially pork overall the meat industry is currently outputting from to million tonnes per year pork poultry and cattle and buffalo as well the off take rate has increased by close to annually at the growth rate was faster in the first half of the decade compared to from animal weight has increased from kg to kghead the number of buffalo which are primarily used as draught animals are declining cattle herds stand at million head in total of which are used for work herd and the annual offtake measured in live weight have grown at since since the annual growth rate has slowed to most farms are small having five animals or less southern vietnam has most of the large farms and high quality pigs in vietnam five percent of pig herds are being reared on an agroindustrial model having genetically improved varieties and commercial feeds the second grouping of farms that produce of the national herd are midsized farms with approximately pigs these farms are in the process of switching to agroindustrial models and in the near future will be a significant engine for the growth of supply seventy percent of pork is sold fresh onto the market and the remaining is processed several processing firms also stated that they would like to import frozen canadian pork the main obstacle for increasing exports after high production costs is the lack of bilateral veterinary agreements russia cis is the only country with bilateral veterinary treaties china malaysia the republic of korea and japan have only issued temporary licenses in general another obstacle is the lack of export finance facilities available to companies either from government sources or from commercial banks government policies encouraging signs the most common complaint among firm executives was the lack of proactive government policies to encourage the animal husbandry and meat processing sectors this attitude began to change in as new policies focused on the agroprocessing industry were passed • on january the prime minister of vietnam has signed the decision no qdttg to provide policies for financial assistance to the agroprocessing sector according to this decision agroprocessing firms may get up to of total investment from the development assistance fund daf daf also provides guaranty of loan value to these firms in case they can get loans or financing from other sources • decision qdttg dated september of the prime minister also gives the green light for agroprocessing firms to obtain loans however interviewed companies stated that it is difficult to get funding from daf funding is determined by provincial peoples committees and shared by different agroprocessing sectors dominated by statecontrolled enterprises regardless of the registration overall daf is made available to less than of private sector companies in vietnam although this accounts for most exports and job growth meat processing companies stated that their preference is other sources of funding usually grey market financing although commercial banks are becoming more and more active the government of vietnam has also created incentives to encourage investment and development in agroprocessing sector resolution no nqtw dated november the government listed livestock breeding as an official production sector in the nations economy this decision will have farreaching effects as the formal recognition of the sector shall provide the foundation for cross ministerial policy platforms and program activities most recently the ministry of finances decision qdbtc dated june provides an incentive bonus for the export of pork at vnd cdn equivalent per worth of export there are a number of other legal documents giving incentives to livestock breeding and processing meat processing equipment according to the ministry of finance is subject to a to import tax tax on equipment for special projects can be waived nevertheless all equipment is subject to a to a vat gst although this needs to be confirmed on a case by case basis depending on the region there may be other tax incentives that could apply to meat processors such as the remote area incentives or other incentives as the deadline for implementation of tariff reductions as part of the asean free trade agreement afta draws closer vietnam will be seriously challenged to maintain and develop its domestic production for processed meats the current tax on imported processed meat products ranges from to of which pork products have the highest tax after the afta treaty is in force in the tax for processed meat will only be the potential impact of the bta and wto treaties are less easy to predict although many countries will reserve preaccession negotiations for commodities such as pork and beef the local companies interviewed were well aware of the changing environment although there is no national association for the sector incountry representation has proven to be the most effective way to sell equipment in vietnam vietnamese consumers like tangible evidence of manufacturers commitment to the market and want to be able to contact them quickly and easily in the event that there are technical issues aftersales service and training are increasingly important sales factors incountry representatives can better understand business customs and regulations to structure equipment sale arrangement more efficiently and costeffectively they are also more able to assist customers in lobbying for soft loan customs procedures delivery tracking etc vietnam is a developing economy and still qualifies for concessionary loans and grants from a number of bilateral and multilateral sources many of which are used by manufacturers of the same country of origin marketing and promotion the most effective way to promote equipment is to participate in trade fairs wherever possible and to organize technical seminars with the participation of enduser companies related ministries and provincial authorities follow up work after seminars should include meetings with the company decisionmakers ministry people are important in cases where firms are state owned marketing materials need to be tailored to the local style and presented in the vietnamese language technical visits to equipment manufacturing sites or toequippedfacilities are useful in providing a more direct marketing approach equipment sales most equipment sales are done on a one to one basis between a dealership or representative and the individual firms executives relationship building is of the utmost importance visited executives have stated that they have received sales people in the past but follow up contact has generally been poor and sporadic the request for catalogues during the research process speaks of the curiosity and the demand site visits to canada are very important and timely business visa processing is critical several firm executives have stated that the difficulty in obtaining canadian visas was taken as a sign that canada in general is not interested in doing business this is a perception that needs to change and change quickly and recent changes to visa issuance through the consulategeneral of canada in hcmc from january will hopefully address some of the concerns most importantly quick turnaround canadian companies wishing to facilitate vietnamese visits to canada should advise the commercial sections of the embassy or consulategeneral as soon as they learn about prospective visits purchases of large equipment in vietnam particularly through stateowned companies are often arranged through tenders it is critical to get to know and work with customers before the tender documents are made and released to the public this is to ensure that the manufacturers equipment specifications match the tender document specifications this takes patience and time financial leasing is a potential source of funding that may have some potential in vietnam particularly as this sector becomes better known and as the sector becomes further liberalized as part of the usvietnam bta payment and contracts payment for imported equipment is generally done through letters of credit this is now a standard method in vietnam any concerns regarding vietnamese issuing institutions can be addressed to the canadian missions in vietnam all contract details should be carefully analyzed especially concerning warranties and replacement parts payment systems and tax liabilities relying on recourse to the law is not a suggested strategy as the vietnamese judicial system is poorly developed and enforcement particularly against stateowned companies difficult offshore arbitration is a common business practice between foreign and domestic parties who enter into serious business relationships again vietnamese courts require enforcement the services of export development canada and of the canadian commercial corporation are available for vietnam for further details contact the canadian missions in vietnam the competition for slaughter line and meat processing equipment as the meat processing sector is in an emerging market period there has yet to be the substantial development of competitive equipment markets having defined company market shares strong demand is only now emerging and companies with a presence in vietnam either representative offices or dealership networks will take the near future market share the danish embassy has focused effort on broadening danish firms access to the animal husbandry and meat processing markets this includes a recent market analysis of the pig meat sector and efforts by their trade division to promote bilateral business relations include the mixed credit program subsidized credit two thirdlevel meat processors under tonnes per year in northern vietnam have recently completed plant upgrades with german equipment vissan executives have already spoken with dutch german italian and spanish manufacturers regarding their million dollar investment plans the competitive equipment market is divided into two categories representative offices and agencies with local firms representative offices most often deal with a broad range of food processing equipment and are focused on larger turnkey factories or more expensive subprocess equipment equipment bearing the brand names of seiderman cossini and mouler are currently sold incountry it is more difficult to identify and verify information on vietnamese trading firms according to the people interviewed in this research these trading firms appear to be opportunistic rarely having exclusive dealership arrangements and reluctant to divulge which equipment they are representing and selling for fear of having incountry competition this dealership relationship is a point to consider for market entry strategy for canadian companies the canadian missions in vietnam can provide advice on individual companies particularly if referred to by third parties a number of countries such as spain the united states and the united kingdom are increasingly focusing on commercial missions aimed at the growing food preparation and packaging sector the canadian missions in vietnam are interested in a similar technical seminar and mission planned for interested parties should contact the missions contacts below

primarily imported from northern european countries these figures were provided by industry executives as well as analysis of published reports and marketing materials from to the present day it is standard practice for vietnamese firms to underreport growth and expansion and the tax and regulatory system has yet to enforce accounting standards given the limited pool of investment capital and

vietnam is a high priority for the government research activities in governmentown institutes are focused on molecular biology and genetic engineering microbial biotechnology for the production of bioactive compounds biofertilizers environmental protection and soil remediation enzyme biotechnology plant biotechnology for invitro conservation the propagation of superior germplasm plant tissue culture for mass propagation of planting material for horticulture fruit and forestry industries and for developing high yield plants and animal biotechnology methods however these research activities are heavily dependent on government funding or overseas development assistance oda support to date there has been little domestic or foreign investment in the sector the government has been developing standards for the industry with a focus on developing regulations to control imports of genetically modified organisms gmos and genetically modified foods gmf and to improve food safety opportunities current priorities for biotechnology development in vietnam focus on the agricultural and forestry sector a few laboratories have been built to conduct research on plant tissue technology for developing high yield crops and the propagation of plants for afforestation vietnam imports modest amounts of laboratory and clinical equipment each year to support its research activities canadian equipment has been reasonably successful several projects are under way involving canadian companies looking to improve the genetic stock of livestock in vietnam but these may be impacted by the bse outbreak despite a recent signature of animal health protocol between the two countries for various animal products including a certificate for exporting swine market access considerations although government interest is high there is limited funding available to address the challenges that vietnam faces in developing its agrifood sector government revenues spent on this sector are less than million per annum with the balance funded by oda or the private sector specifically there are concerns regarding vietnams poor record in intellectual property protection as well as shortages of qualified technical staff this limits the demand for biotechnology in the short term with limited expertise on the local market interested exporters should look at partnering with a regional company that is likely to have better connections within vietnam and more interest in investment key participants since rice is the dominant commodity in vietnams agricultural sector holding position number

has combinedflavored drinks like orangemango and orangepineapple prospects research firm ac nielsen reported that the market for powdered juice drinks is still growing although at a slower rate compared to readytodrink juices according to players they expect the segment to post continued growth in the next three to five years performance will be driven mainly by strong demand for economy packs while those in bigger packs will continue to post steady growth rates the entry of new players despite the pullout of urc indicates a growing market existing players view this as a challenge since more would mean more product options for the consumer industry sources say innovation would remain vital for success most importantly the trend towards healthier betterforyou products is still expected to fuel growth as powdered juice presents itself as a better beverage than substitutes like ice tea and carbonated drinks now there is a pending bill in congress which seeks to prohibit the use of aspartame a sweetener used in powdered juices overall though industry players project a bright future for their business in the short term sales are expected to moveup as consumers gulp more of

pacific pasta is the generic italian term for many noodlelike doughs that are made in a wide variety of shapes and sizes according to the national pasta association of the united states more than pasta shapes are produced around the world whose names come from their shape although its true beginnings are somewhat unclear italy is recognized as the home of pasta in modern times this is attributed to the italian traveler marco polo who is said to have brought pasta to italy from china years ago pasta then reached the united kingdom through aristocrats touring europe by the nineteenth

pasta pasta secca dried pasta is readily available in many sizes and shapes it is factory made and fully dried before it is packaged it rarely contains eggs so it can be stored indefinitely without refrigerating or freezing its firmness also allows it to be stored easily without damage fresh pasta pasta fresca fresh pasta is available in a variety of sizes and shapes but not to the extent of dried pasta it also comes in a greater variety of flavors fresh pasta most often contains eggs and has high water content making refrigeration or freezing necessary to keep it from spoiling global

of total value of imports pasta exports ballooned from only a little over tons us million in to tons us million in in volumes improved by to tons us million from exports grew by more than annually on volume and by yearly on value this was because of the very low base in of only tons amounting to us as compared to tons worth us million in exports of pasta by country of destination source prospects players see the pasta market to maintain its growth of to in the next three to five years performance will still be driven by the numerous fiestas and celebrations all over the country the growth in population and incomes are also seen to help the business keep its uphill climb the edge of instant noodles over pasta is its ease of preparation minutes compared to pasta which normally requires to minutes to address this concern players say the consumers must be taught innovative ways of using pasta aside from the usual spaghetti or baked macaroni in recent years the marketing strategies used to boost sales included bundling pasta with a complementing product – sauces rfm corporation meanwhile utilized a celebrity to endorse its product and placed her picture on the packaging another strategy employed by unilever bestfoods is the emphasis on the vitamin and mineral content of pasta to attract healthconscious consumers another growth factor for the industry is the expanding fast food industry where spaghetti remains as a favorite menu item importers meanwhile expect slower expansion rate for imported pasta as it competes with local pasta in terms of quality but sold at more

america usa with a share of china brazil and european union us food and drug administration fda philippines bureau of animal industry bai among the asian countries china japan and thailand have consistently been the top producers however china and thailand are not exporters while japan is a net importer the philippines is way behind producing an average of only tons per year consumption world consumption of chicken meat in reached m tons the usa is the worlds largest consumer both in aggregate and per capita terms it is among the lowest when compared to asian countries like japan kg per capita and thailand kg but higher than indonesia kg and india kg it is even far lower compared to developed countries like the usa and canada with kg and kg respectively brazil australia and new zealand also have high consumption of more than kilograms per capita poultry international may exports world poultry exports in were almost stagnant compared to as major importing countries banned the entry of poultry products because of the outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai the outbreak led major producers in asia such as thailand and china to stop exporting chilled and frozen chicken on the other hand some countries still managed to sustain positive growth despite the impact of hpai world chicken exports in thousand tons country p f brazil united states european union thailand china philippines others world total p preliminary f forecast source japan for instance which sourced bulk of its processed chicken requirement from thailand had reduced tremendously its imports from this country and looked for alternative sources because of the philippines proximity to japan and because it was hpaifree during the major outbreak it paved the way for philippine chicken to enter the japanese market the first shipment to japan was in march by san miguel purefoods for exports of chicken meat and meat cuts reached tons industry data bulk of exports was in the form of frozen boneless leg and frozen wing stick recently however there have been reports that a lowrisk bird flu strain has reached the philippines imports import demand for broiler meat has declined by in the big importers like japan and china have reduced the entry of poultry products into their territories by as much as and respectively due to the hpai world broiler imports in thousand tons country p f russian federation japan european union china saudi arabia mexico hong kong philippines others world total p preliminary f forecast source russia is the number one importer and the biggest market for the united states it is followed by japan which has high demand for boneless chicken meat and the european union eu the eu imposes the strictest environmental and animal welfare laws exporting to eu entails the highest cost the philippines imposes quantitative restrictions on poultry imports the country imports chicken meat and meat cuts in order to augment local supply imports reached a high of million kg in up by from in chicken leg quarters accounted of the total meat imports while deboned chicken and chicken cuts cornered the rest of the imports were in the form of whole chicken and chicken fats which contributed a measly share prices and cost movements in live broiler prices in key countries reflect developments in world broiler trade among the key countries china and brazil experienced decreasing prices of live broilers brazil registered the lowest prices ranging from ppkg while thailand recorded lower prices relative to china and the philippines the philippines although not a major world producer as compared to thailand and china had higher broiler prices of ppkg live broiler prices are reflective of the cost of production a comparison of cost performance across key broiler countries in asia showed that brazil was the lowest cost producer as it had the lowest cost of corn and soybean meal china in contrast had the lowest labor cost the philippines posted the highest input cost particularly for corn and dayold chicks doc comparison of cost performance as of item raw materials philippines thailand brazil china corn pkg soybean meal pkg doc ppc grown broiler pkg source yanson the plus factors the philippine broiler industry possesses a competitive edge first filipino buyers still prefer warm meat over frozen meat because of this the entry of frozen chicken remains limited as household consumers still prefer to buy fresh chilled chicken over frozen ones second the philippines is fortunate not to be included in the hpai affected areas during the major outbreak in while there have been reports that a lowrisk flu strain found in ducks has already entered the country the philippines was able to confine it in a small isolated farm the philippines was somehow given time for hpai preparedness through prevention programs crafted by industry players and government another plus factor is the expected growth in chicken consumption due to its price advantage versus other meats higher per capita income and increase in population can we compete the philippines even with its advantage of being hpaifree can barely export chicken due to uncompetitive cost the countrys cost of production is way above other producing countries due to high cost of corn and doc corn is a major input to broiler feeds accounting for about of cost the philippines can export provided it has access to low cost of inputs a low tariff corn from thailand for example could help lower the total cost of production another possibility is to concentrate on higher valueadded chicken addressing the demand for cooked products in other countries such as japan brazil will remain as the biggest exporter of chicken to the world followed by the us the us is strong in bonein legs export due to consumers preference for white meat the eu which has the most stringent environmental and animal welfare laws will continue to be a major exporter thailand is slowly shifting to cooked products form instead of frozen chicken this is where the philippines can also come in with cost considerations the philippine broiler industry will continue to be an importdependent industry

our standards and then market it globally from malaysia australia and new zealand were two main suppliers of halal beef for malaysia besides being a promoted sector in malaysia there was a huge market for halal products globally she said malaysias potential as a halal hub was primarily due to it being a muslim country while the country has been the front runner in promoting the halal sector by incorporating domestic and international halal standards as well as producing halal products by using various technologies she said this when responding to a question on malaysias competitive position in becoming a halal hub and on the upcoming world halal forum in kuala lumpur at a seminar on business opportunities in malaysia thursday rafidah is leading a trade and investment mission to canada

includes hygienic practices and products used in the process of producing the goods and services the minister said investments in the halal sector especially in the eastern corridor in states like

vietnam exporter guide vietnam usda vietnam agrifood past present and future report vietnam aafc spotlight on singapore some conclusions for canada from this scenario • singapore is aseans most developed nation with a welldeveloped consumer market underpinned by sophisticated middle and upper income groups singapore currently has a population of about million people population growth is slow and is being supplemented by immigration the population is expected to grow to million people by although young in profile singapore now has an ageing population of singaporeans are aged or younger and will be an important element of the consumer market in future the economy remains strongly growth oriented but middle income consumer confidence is undermined by fears over job losses which are a relatively new phenomenon in singapore over million visitors arrive in singapore every year confirming singapore’s reputation as a regional transportation hub the food supply chain is modern and well developed with most food products now being purchased at supermarkets culturally wet markets still have some importance for those people who like to buy their fresh produce at these venues this situation has developed since the mids singapores economy is based on its prowess as a base for manufacturing industries and as a financial centre but singapore is facing problems arising from being a higher cost manufacturing base than other countries eg china and malaysia the singapore government is in the process of restructuring the economic development focus in order to establish more jobs for its citizens and continued economic growth and prosperity in future economic commentators forecast that singapore should see positive economic development over the next years under circumstances where there are no major shocks to the global economy when taken together under the developing asean free trade area and their longstanding historical links singapore brunei and neighbouring malaysia can form the core of aseans higher income group consumer market in future under circumstances of positive economic development by the middle and upper income consumers in these three countries could number up to million people a target market of similar size to canada today singapore and brunei will continue to have strong demand for imported agrifood products and processed food and beverages bruneis demand will continue to be supported by reexport trade from singapore and to a lesser extent malaysia the trend towards diet modernization that is fully evident in singapore and brunei today will increase demand for temperate climate commodities and food ingredients eg wheat feed materials but the industries that use these products will probably not been based in singapore or brunei in the longer term afta and the already wellestablished links with malaysia are likely to see both countries become even more reliant on malaysianbased industries probably owned by singapore and brunei businesses for a broader range of foodstuffs than today this is already starting to happen in some industries eg wheat flour bread dry noodles and to a lesser extent beer though not brunei and some frozen foods singapore – pork prices may rise by up to the price of pork which has been rising steadily over the past year could jump because of a drought in one of singapores biggest suppliers australia but for now retailers said they intend to absorb the price hike supermarket chain fairprice said it would hold the price of its chilled pork steady for as long as possible current shelf prices range from per kg of lean meat to about for a kg of ribs between january and october this year more than tonnes of pork were consumed here the drought has taken a toll on crops over the past year with shortages causing september grain prices to skyrocket the apl spokesman added that wheat prices rose from a s per tonne to a agrifood news from the region singapore singapore – organic food boom boosting sales sunny singapore seems to be in the midst of an organic food craze the strong appetite for organic food thanks to the growing number of wellnessminded consumers here and concerns over food safety is seeing companies involved in natural eatables chewing on bigtime success among them is cold storage which opened the islands first organic supermarket naturally marketplace at vivocity last year naturally marketplace offers nearly organic product lines ranging from milk to wines to cleaning aids organic food in cold storage has been enjoying steady doubledigit growth historically demand for organic products came mostly from the large western expatriate communities but recently the demand for organic foods has expanded to include locals health consultant sim nget seer of biogenic international told bt that demand is definitely growing judging by the number of organic retail outlets that have sprouted up recently ms sim also felt that local consumers are becoming more health conscious and this is partly a result of the increased number of healthcare talks which have raised their awareness about healthy diet according to britains organic monitor the estimated retail sales for singapore organic food market stood at about us million last year across asia the market size is set to hit close to us billion this year it added this is not surprising given the numerous articles of food safety crisis that consumers are bombarded with almost daily including contaminated fish listeria in ice the bird flu hni virus and high levels of pesticides found in vegetables business times singapore january prima offers a taste of singapore in vancouver franchising is primas launchpad for spreading its wings overseas and canada is a natural stop for the flourbased food group vancouver on canadas west coast is a cosmopolitan city and there is growing interest among mainstream canadians in panasian cuisine says lewis cheng general manager of prima food the food manufacturing licensing and franchising arm of the group he says the groups prima taste restaurants serve authentic singapore food like laksa prawn mee mee siam and hainanese chicken rice they constitute a unique version of panasian cuisine as the food has evolved over the years through a confluence of the various culinary traditions and styles of our major races we believe that canadas resident population would therefore be receptive to a panasian restaurant concept like the prima taste restaurant mr cheng says through a franchise agreement prima opened its first canadian prima taste true singapore cuisine concept restaurant in early october the canadian franchisee is committed to open at least prima taste restaurants in the country within the next five years launched last year the prima taste true singapore cuisine restaurant franchise already has outlets in major cities like vancouver shanghai and beijing there are also restaurants in san jose in the united states jakarta and bandung in indonesia and manila in the philippines the next franchised outlets will be opening in surabaya indonesia hangzhou china taipei taiwan and colombo sri lanka mr cheng discloses the prima taste brands mission is to serve authentic singapore cuisine in the world he says and we believe that through franchising we will be able to work with local partners for the various target markets for optimum growth and results thanks to the franchise system mr cheng says prima is on track to build a chain of singapore restaurants around the world each restaurant will serve a wide variety of authentic singapore cuisine that is consistently delicious anywhere in the world providing a uniquely singapore dining experience venturing into canada is not without its problems because canada is in a different time zone operational support becomes more challenging and costly mr cheng says in terms of regulatory requirements we need to comply with their disclosure laws which can be tedious and costly while there are restaurants in canada which serve malaysian thai and eastwest fusion food he says there is no restaurant offering genuine singapore food in vancouver this would provide for quality assurance and minimise any potential conflict delays and miscommunication business times singapore october agrifood news from the region indonesian livestock food industries suffer from meat bone meal shortage the indonesian poultry food industries are suffering from meat bone meal shortage as the import of the product is disrupted by rumour about illegal meat bone meal the chairperson of the association of livestock food companies gpmt budiarto subijanto reveals that mbm stocks at companies warehouses are diminishing while the imported mbm at ports are hard to release it has been a month importers cannot release their mbm from ports since the department of agriculture has not given their permission he informed yesterday to release mbm from ports he continued importers had to have letter of request for livestock food import at the moment thousands of containers of mbm are piling at ports as the minister of agriculture has yet signed a single letter of request the minister of agriculture reasons that the directorate general of animal husbandry has yet made any recommendation however we have not been able to contact the director general of animal husbandry mathur riady as he is going abroad at the moment added budiarto according to him the imported mbm piling at ports had met the necessary requirements such as bill of lading bl import document invoice certificate of origin and certificate of animal health he stated that the mbm products were imported from countries free from the foodandmouth disease such as new zealand and australia outside of facing mbm or raw material shortage livestock food industries also suffer from losses on the requirement to pay for usus per day per container in demorage fee fine imposed on delays in getting imported goods from ports a company has to spend idr millionidr million per container for days in delay or around idr millionidr million per container per month complained budiarto separately marketing director of pt sierad produce albert sitorus disclosed that the company had to spend us per container per day in demurrage fee since three weeks ago as a result we are forced to reduce our losses by burdening the additional costs to the customers animal breeders said albert according to him if the mbm could not be released from ports the livestock food companies would be forced to use poultry meat mealsas a consequence inserted albert the prices of livestock food would soar as the use of poultry meat meals increase production costs up by idr per kilogram the loan

remote regions the adb said the communist country which was a net rice importer in the late s is now the worlds number two exporter of rice and coffee and a major international supplier of tea cashew nuts and rubber access to new technologies by farmers and agrobased enterprises is essential as vietnams agriculture is gradually shifting its focus from increased production volumes to increased production values the adb said source xfnasia jan material imports hindering development of animal feed processors dependence on imported materials is laying heavy pressure on the vietnamese animal

animal feed and materials for processing an onyear rise of agrifood news from the region bid to win over fussy beef buyers the importance asian consumers place on food taste and quality can be seen in the way meat is promoted and presented in supermarkets throughout taiwan singapore and japan details on how the beef is produced features strongly on packaging along with enticing messages about health benefits and taste the information is delivered to consumers via branding with nearly all meat in asian stores sold under a brand heavily promoted with stickers posters and glossy brochures common themes include naturally fresh delicious and tasty or tender and succulent this is in stark contrast to australian supermarkets where most red meat is sold generically without brand names or detailed consumer information it is estimated that in japan alone there are at least different beef brands every food imaginable in japanese supermarkets appears to be branded and priced accordingly for example one shop had a display of tomatoes that looked the same depending on the brand some were twice as expensive and shoppers were buying them meat and livestock australia japan manager samantha jamieson said the importance of product branding and image could not be underestimated in that market branding is so powerful in japan ms jamieson said part of mlas work in asia is helping to develop and support meat brands promoted by australian exporters or producer groups mla southeast asia and china regional manager tim kelf said the importance of branding in countries such as taiwan and singapore was slightly different to japan where the culture was image driven he said southeast asian branding aimed at building customer loyalty and creating a product that had more value to retailers than just price in places such as singapore australian beef had to compete against lowpriced meat from brazil or indian buffalo mr kelf who has worked in asia for more than years said australia couldnt compete at the lower end of the market on price so they worked to create relationships with higherend retailers in the mid s when brazilian beef was allowed into singapore we went from selling tonnes to tonnes the next year he said thats what happens when these guys come to town we lose the bottom end of the market because we cant compete thats why a lot of the work we do is based around brands and building customer loyalty vietnam’s livestock sector under various threats high feed prices rampant pandemics unplanned production and weak food hygiene and safety are

ministry of religious affairs through the board for issuing halal import permits for products that satisfy the halal requirements islam has introduced the concept of slaughter whereby an animal would have to be properly slaughtered to be considered halal the act of slaughtering is to ensure the quality of meat and to avoid any microbial contamination for example a dead but unslaughtered animal is normally associated with disease most disease originate from animals blood therefore slaughtering is mandatory to ensure that complete drainage of blood from the animals body thus minimizing the chance of microbial infection this is compatible with the overall concept of cleanliness that is always emphasised in islam haram haram is a quranic term which means prohibited or unlawlful all foods are considered halal except the following • swineporkdog and its byproducts • alcohol and intoxicants • carnivorous animals birds of prey and land animals without external ears • amphibious animals such as frogs crocodiles and turtles • animals improperly slaughtered or dead before slaughtering • food contaminated with any of the above products the halal ingredients must not be mixed or even come into contact with haram materials such as products from pig or dog during storage transport cooking serving etc • foods containing ingredients such as gelatin enzymes emulsifiers etc are musbooh

for food and agri business university of asia and the pacific after the countrys accession to the world trade organization in there was a lot of apprehension and anxiety among the different sectors of philippine society this was formalized with the passage in of republic act ra known as the agricultural tariffication act which provided for the replacement of quantitative restrictions on agricultural products with tariffs if one is to go by the sentiments of farmers and causeoriented groups that move was premature and there was much to lose in trade liberalization on the other hand the more progressive sectors saw this as a step towards opportunities in the global market enabling mechanisms the former sentiment was all the more felt in the agriculture and fishery sector with the philippines being an agriculturebased economy given that poverty is highest in the agricultural sector the government had to allay the fears of farmers and fisherfolks as an immediate response to the perceived negative effects of liberalization the agricultural competitiveness enhancement fund acef was set in place together with the tariffication act the fund shall be set aside and earmarked by congress for irrigation farmtomarket roads postharvest equipment and facilities credit research and development other marketing infrastructure provision of market information retraining extension services and other forms of assistance and support to the agricultural sector another legislative measure enacted was the agriculture and fisheries modernization act of afma or ra senator angara during his stint as da secretary in had this to say after seven years of implementation and seven da secretaries from its approval the agriculture and fisheries sector is still struggling the amendment with its longer prescriptive period seems to be a manifestation that the intent of the law has not been met if it is any consolation the amendment already explicitly states that the amount appropriated for afma shall be in addition to the annual budget of the da however the additional funding requirement remains to be seen as the government budget has not been approved prior to the afma there was supposed to be a budget for safety nets to the tune of p billion to address concerns related to the countrys accession to the gattwto the das annual budget was around p billion broken into the regular and gatt related activities with the afma the average annual budget stood at almost the same level but the gatt term was replaced by afma the additional money provided by law was nowhere in sight ie p billion in the first year and p billion for the succeeding six years the backbone according to then secretary angara there are two main outstanding concepts in afma that sort of tie up all its various elements and if correctly implemented would totally transform the agricultural landscape first is the bottomup planning and implementation of programs with the involvement of all stakeholders under the principal leadership of local government units lgus the second is the concept of strategic agriculture and fisheries development zones safdzs or food baskets on the first point agriculture and fishery programs are still planned and implemented from the top to bottom since bulk of the funds and resources are channeled through national government agencies afmas very important concept of the safdzs was intended to rationalize the allocation and use of the remaining and available agricultural lands in the country and to set aside strategicallylocated prime lands for the modernization of agriculture and fishery sectors unfortunately the safdz concept as a food basket or food center as others would prefer to call it has been too associated with monetary considerations this perception stemmed from government pronouncements that it is in these zones where the bulk of governments scarce funds for agriculture and fisheries would be concentrated thus these zones are convergence areas for total agroindustrial development where concerned national government agencies will pour much needed infrastructure technical credit and marketing support services this resulted to the inclusion in some identified safdzs of entire areas of barangays and municipalities which were not strategicallylocated prime lands for agriculture and fisheries modernization the thinking was that the more safdzs the more money for the lgu this also led to the delay in the delineation and identification of safdz which should have been finished within one year from the effectivity of the afma law but was completed in the bureau of soils and water management completed the preparation of safdz maps and the digitization of regional maps and some provincialmunicipal safdz maps it is also reported that as of september of all municipalities have prepared sangguniang bayan resolution adopting the safdz however there are claims that the safdzs are not being utilized as intended since the maps are difficult to interpret at the lgu level there was lack of consultation with stakeholders on their identification and there is still land conversion despite the safdzs the safdzs were hardly used as a planning and implementation tool to maximize productivity promote efficiency and equity and accelerate modernization rice as an afma barometer since rice is the countrys major staple and receives the most support from the government through its banner programs it may give an indicative picture of afmas influence from the preafma to the postafma years palay production has been increasing over the last twelve years with growth averaging however the severest el niño that hit the country in caused production to decline by although recovery was made in the following years with sustained growth growth over the preafma years without the effect of the severe el niño averaged which was slightly above the growth during the post afma years at area harvested over the preafma years grew by annually excluding the year when it dropped by during the post afma years area hardly moved at growth and stood at four million hectares from palay production and area harvested source of basic data bas considering as a reference year it would be noted that succeeding productions were all above the base year at an increasing rate except for due to the severe el niño phenomenon rice production index source of basic data bas in terms of regional distribution five regions account for almost of total production led by central luzon western visayas cagayan valley and the ilocos there has been no considerable change in production distribution among the regions in the pre and postafma years bas production growth during the post afma years has been largely due to the sustained growth of yield averaging during the period compared to the growth from the post afma years were characterized by the intensified campaign on the use of hybrid and inbred seeds average yield source bas the philippines is still a net importer of rice despite the mandate of afma for selfsufficiency there were minimal imports in but a sharp surge was experienced in likely caused by the el niño phenomenon in imports peaked in at two million tons as a result of the severe el niño and again reached over one million tons in rice imports during the preafma period averaged tons which grew to an average tons from total import expenditure amounted to us billion and us billion during the preafma and postafma period respectively total imports for reached million tons while in imports are projected at million tons comparing the volume indices it can be seen that there have not been enough spikes in production to abate the seeming periodic surges in imports following the occurrence of an extreme weather disturbance such as the el niño production and import volume index source of basic data bas and nso given the pre and post afma rice situation while there is an absolute increase in production basically coming from yield growth this has not been enough to address the growing demand as reflected from rising imports the interventions provided by the law seemingly have not had as much impact as intended due to reasons such as lack of funds and nonimplementation of several important provisions the afma as provided in the law itself is currently under review by a team of experts who have set out to evaluate the implementation of the law given its various components it is hoped that the review as well as the extension of the mandated funding support to will provide the impetus to turn around agriculture and fishery towards modernization and competitiveness references bureau of agricultural statistics httpbswmdagovph implementing rules and regulations of republic act national

interest in relevant agrifood commodities senen u reyes senior management specialistcenter for food and agri business the pitch for biofuels the growing thrust towards a cleaner and greener environment has led to the search for more renewable sources of fuel and energy the advent of the kyoto protocol and its concomitant effects of carbon trading have provided impetus to renewed interest in biofuels biofuels are increasingly used in many countries for environmental and economic reasons two of the more popular biofuels are ethanol and biodiesel for gasoline and diesel engines respectively ethanol is a high octane renewable fuel which can be produced from a number of different feedstocks like sugarcane corn cassava and other crops meanwhile biodiesel production uses domestic raw materials from coconut oil palm jatropha used cooking oil and other biomass sources thus a significant multiplier can cut across the supply chain from growing to manufacturing and logistics the requirement for locally grown feedstocks will increase utilization of agricultural land promote investment and create jobs biodiesel is also an environmentfriendly product that dramatically cuts emissions at the same time with the rising cost of crude oil the economics of biodiesel has become somewhat favorable moreover the production of biodiesel can save foreign exchange a scarce resource in a developing country the development of biofuels has found even more relevance given the continuing uncertainties of middle east supply as well as those of other major oil fields and the rising petroleumbased fuel prices a recent study reviewed by the wall street journal revealed that the worlds biggest producing field saudi arabias ghawar is possibly declining in output in addition mexicos cantarell oil field which is the worlds second largest will be declining at a significant rate in the next few years agricultural implications these are but a few reasons for the much talked about alternative fuel or biofuels how will this shape the agricultural landscape on a general note higher demand for ethanol and biodiesel due to the oil crisis would have a positive effect on agriculture given the opportunities in terms of value adding for traditional crops on the other hand it would put pressure on the production of agricultural feedstocks particularly on sugarcane corn cassava coconut and oil palm it raises the issues of how much additional areas can be planted and the competing uses for food feeds and fuel ethanol based on an average annual gasoline consumption of four billion liters the government is proposing an initial mix of ethanol to gasoline over the next two years this will require an annual production of million liters of ethanol which translates to million tons of sugarcane or tons of corn or million tons of cassava table estimates indicate that if the feedstock requirements were to be supplied from existing production in sugarcane and corn will have to give up nine percent each while cassava will entail a substantial of production to support the fuel ethanol program table modes to cover feedstock requirement sugarcane corn cassava a from existing production yield tonsha additional area ha c from increased productivity bas cfauap estimates over the past five years has been the highest production year for sugarcane and corn while it has also been a good year for cassava table historically there have been no regular surges in production this would mean that a higher percentage will be required for the other years which would put added pressure on the raw material supply for other uses like sweeteners food grain feeds starch and alcohol the competing uses will likely boil down to a question of who gives a better farmgate price bas if the requirement were to be produced from an expansion in area harvested sugarcane will need hectares corn hectares and cassava hectares based on the incremental increases from year to year there have been no area expansions in all three crops which would approximate the required feedstock table this is especially true for cassava which needs an additional three quarters of the current area however the sugar industry has already identified more than hectares for sugarcane plantings to support ethanol production enough for a blend bas the third option of generating the feedstock requirement from increased productivity on existing areas is relatively a tall order given the yield performance of the three crops over the past several years table while sugarcane has been the better yield performer among the three it has not reached a yield increment required for the desired volume this is true also for corn and cassava which need and yield increments respectively to meet the requirements the incremental yields for sugarcane have been around in three of the past four years while corn yield increments have been and in source of basic data bas biodiesel in terms of biodiesel the government proposal is for a blend of biodiesel to petroleum diesel at an estimated diesel demand of seven billion liters the country will need million liters or kg of biodieselmethyl ester table this can be supplied from two basic feedstocks coconut oil and palm oil the required quantity of feedstock to get a kilogram or liter of biodiesel is almost the same for both types of oil the big difference lies in the yield advantage of palm oil over coconut oil which reduces the oil palm area needed to generate the entire requirement it has the highest production and yield which would need lesser land for expansion its productivity has been continuously improving over the years with an industry target of tons cane a distinct advantage of sugarcane is its industry structure which is highly organized and consolidated with strong private sector involvement the sugar industry has been bullish about the ethanol potential so much so that it has identified the specific areas for expansion and is supporting the establishment of ethanol plants however this can work to the philippine advantage by using palm oil for the domestic market while bringing the coconut oil to the export market as a final note the test of ethanol and biodiesel would be the market acceptability in terms of pump price which would be the first consideration of consumers and the expected benefits to the vehicle environment and agriculture biofuels will give the otherwise traditional crops a boost towards value added processing references aguiba melody m sugar production for ethanol pushed

cattle and goats are raised primarily on roughages poultry feed production on the other hand is mainly for chicken and duck initially aquaculture feeds have been considered a minor subsector of the feedmilling industry but today the production of fish feeds is the fastest growing feed market table shows the mixed feed production volume in the philippines from based on data from the bureau of animal industry bai as of december a total of commercial feedmillers were registered with bai with an aggregate capacity of tonsday based on an hour work shift of these are geographically located in luzon while are in the visayas and in mindanao some feedmills can be found in the national capital region and the surrounding provinces of southern tagalog and central luzon these three regions

feeds are mainly consumed in the provinces of batangas bulacan and pampanga while pig feeds are in greatest demand in bulacan cebu and batangas aquaculture feed production total aquaculture feed production in was estimated at tons consisting mainly of milkfish tilapia and shrimp feeds table milkfish farms are mostly located in pangasinan and bulacan tilapia feed demand is high in luzon particularly from taal lake magat dam pantabangan dam and several small lakes in laguna province as for the shrimp feed market this has shrunk substantially from over tons in to about tons in consumption was highest in the visayas particularly in negros occidental while some are consumed in mindanao mainly in agusan del norte and south cotabato luzon consumption had decreased considerably due to the many disease problems plaguing the shrimp farming industry majority of the farmers have either ceased operation or have shifted production to intensive milkfish culture most companies offer a single feed formulation for the culture of milkfish tilapia catfish and carp conceivably to reduce inventory cost and simplify stock management it is interesting to note that most of the shrimp feed manufacturers in the country have had at one time or another some form of partnership with taiwanese aquafeed companies major feed ingredients the major feed ingredients used in aquaculture feeds in the country are limited to about seven to ten the majority of which are imported aquaculture feeds currently utilize about imported raw materials for fish feeds and imported raw materials for shrimp feeds as compared to only for livestock and poultry feeds four ingredients can be said to have serious competing uses these being soybean oil meal rice bran fishmeal and wheat byproducts by contrast all the soybean oil meal is imported while limited amounts of fish meal and meat and bone meal are produced locally wheat and its byproducts on the other hand are produced by local flour mills from imported grains rice bran and copra meal are sourced exclusively in the country yellow corn corn is the second most important agricultural crop in the country with total output of million tons in the major corn growing provinces are isabela in luzon and bukidnon north cotabato lanao del sur and maguindanao in mindanao yellow corn is used as a major raw material for poultry feeds and pig feeds while white corn is produced mainly for human food it is the staple cereal in several provinces in central and eastern visayas and in parts of mindanao although it is also sometimes used as a feedstuff for pigs and poultry in fish feeds yellow corn is rarely used and if so only in small quantities soybean meal soybean meal is the most widely used high protein plant feed ingredient the philippines is dependent on foreign supply with imports in totaling more than a million tons the extent of utilization of soybean in feeds is affected by world market prices for the last five years importation has fluctuated from a low of tons in to a high of million tons in although the philippines has vast tracts of land ideal for producing soybean production and transport costs are relatively high making local production presently uncompetitive rice bran the philippines produced an average of million tons per year of paddy from to with production coming mainly from the provinces of nueva ecija and isabela in luzon iloilo and negros occidental in the visayas and zamboanga del sur and bukidnon in mindanao in terms of rice bran this amounted to tons annually at of the paddy weight as rice is a seasonal crop then so is the availability of rice bran which has a peak supply during the fourth quarter this trend is closely associated with the supply of irrigation water from the monsoon rains which favor harvesting during the late third quarter and the last quarter of the year the lean months are observed between the first and third quarters when it is dry in many provinces fish meal despite the countrys vast natural fishery resources the animal feedmilling industry depends heavily on imported fishmeal total fishmeal imports in amounted to tons mainly form peru fishmeal imports have increased by since s with peruvian fishmeal being the most commonly used fishmeal for livestock poultry and fish feeds the other types of imported fish meal which are typically used for shrimps include chilean american alaskan canadian japanese brown and white fish meal compared to other major feedstuffs the tariff on fish meal imports is at unfortunately there is no record of local fishmeal production which depends mainly on the use of tuna cannery rejects and byproducts the bulk of tuna fishmeal is produced in general santos the location of the five largest tuna canning plants in the country sardine canneries also generate large quantities of fish byproducts but only a small portion of this is processed into fish meal due to its high oil content the bulk of these fish waste end up in the production of local fish sauces sardine canneries are mainly located in metro manila a number can be found in cebu and zamboanga there are a total of eight tuna canneries and at least nine major sardine canneries throughout the country the prospects of a fish meal manufacturing industry are even more uncertain today with increasingly limiting fish resources wheat and byproducts wheat supply into the country is all imported a total of tons of unmilled wheat was imported from the china india australia and canada in approximately of the wheat imports are used for flour production and milled for use in animal feeds feedwheat is being taxed at as this competes with local corn while the import tariff for breadwheat is only at copra meal the philippines is the worlds largest coconut producer and supplies much of the demand of copra meal around the globe in some tons of unmilled copra were exported entirely to china the volume of copra meal utilized locally for feeds is estimated to be at least tons per year other ingredients vitamins and mineral additives used in animal feeds are all imported with the exception of some natural mineral supplements such as calcium phosphates and oyster shell for livestock and poultry feeds commercial vitamin premixes are widely available even for retail sale due to the numerous small noncommercial feed millers in the country by contrast fish and shrimp premixes are uncommon due to the limited market and also because many aquafeed millers import their requirements directly some shrimp feed manufacturers which have taiwanese partners usually obtain their premixes directly from taiwan although details of the premix composition are usually not disclosed for proprietary reasons at present local production of animal oils for use in feeds is minimal and generally poor in quality sardine cannery waste and fat trimmings from abattoirs are major resources of potential value to the feed industry however manufacturers have to first properly source raw materials and invest in good handling and processing equipment marketing and distribution being archipelagic in nature the distance of many of the countrys islands makes a multilevel marketing channel inevitable and this significantly adds to the cost of local feeds and feedstuffs imported feed ingredients are channeled from the importer to wholesaler which may be the same entity to the distributor and dealers however local feed ingredients such as corn rice bran and copra meal pass through a more intricate marketing channel originating from the farmer or miller through several levels of traders before reaching the feedmiller fish and shrimp feeds are usually packed in woven polypropylene pp bags provided with an inner polyethylene pe lining all feed companies pack grower and finisher fish feeds in kilogram kg bags since quite a number of farmers compute their feed inputs in terms of bags rather than kilograms mash feeds are packed either in or kg pelined pp bags while crumbled feeds are packed in or kg pelined pp bags feed bags are mechanically sealed by stitching by contrast livestock and poultry feeds are usually packed in kg woven pp bags with no inner lining fish feeds are normally marketed from the manufacturer to a network of distributors dealers and even subdealers due to the distance of many fish farms however large feed manufacturers like vitarich universal robina and san miguel which have established companyowned distribution channels for poultry and livestock feeds are usually able to market directly to the subdealer level or consumer level by contrast other feed companies tap the marketing networks of provincial and municipal traders for shrimp feeds the marketing channel is simpler since farms are never too far from a city or major town from the manufacturer or importer the channel passes only through a distributor then directly to the farmer in general each level of trader from the farmer to the distributor makes profit while dealers and retailers who sell directly to the end user make a margin of from the source of the raw material ie farmer miller or importer up to the feed manufacturer the marketing cost including the cost of transport adds from at least to on to the acquisition cost the farther the feed miller from the source the higher is its cost of feedstuffs for this reason large feed manufacturers often have personnel agents or direct suppliers at the trading area allowing them to substantially cut down their raw material cost which small feedmillers are unable to do feeds are generally marketed in cash or in credit terms of days with cash purchases given attractive discounts in the case of shrimp feeds the stiff competition over the remaining market has forced some companies to offer credit terms in excess of days the pricing of manufactured feeds in general is affected by the import price of the major feedstuffs such as soybean oil meal and wheat and the seasonal availability of local feed ingredients at times when the supply is tight it is not uncommon for feedstuff suppliers to require feedmillers to book and pay for their orders in advance outlook feed production by smallscale and backyard operations are consequently almost totally unaccounted for moreover it has not been possible to establish an official figure for the size of the entire feed manufacturing industry in the philippines since only commercial operations are registered with the government and the registration of noncommercial feed milling is currently only voluntary furthermore it is common practice for some feedmillers as well as farmers and other business entities to understate their actual production for various reasons for many years now various government institutions have been promoting the production of homemixed feeds for poultry livestock and fish the prospect of producing homemixed feeds to reduce feed cost are attractive not only for largescale farming operations but also for farms that are located in distant rural areas where hauling cost is high the supply of commercial feeds is irregular and the freshness of feeds is generally lower however homemixer feedmills for aquaculture have failed to prosper in the country and this can be explained by the a high cost and erratic supply of raw materials b high capital requirement and c lack of equipment designed for smallscale operation in the open market traders of feed ingredients also tend to be more accommodating as far as credit is concerned to clients who purchase in large quantities whereas small purchases usually have to be paid in cash furthermore during lean months or shortage in raw material it is almost always the large feedmiller that is prioritized by the trader many noncommercial poultry and livestock feed manufacturers for these reasons are already shifting back to the use of commercial feeds which is turning out to be more practical and economical the countrys mediumterm philippine development plan for aims to increase aquaculture production by developing hectares of new areas including seaweeds while for livestock the target is hectares of new lands new areas for development are projected to expand the feed market for aquaculture by at least the poultry and livestock sectors on the other hand have been registering annual growth rates of at least with broiler chicken production expected to grow by as much as in these developments and growth targets will therefore exert tremendous pressure on the countrys feed resources in the not so distant future

divided into three groups large manufacturers neighborhood bakers and the cottage or backyard producers the large manufacturers are the ones which produce majority of the popular biscuit and cookie brands found in leading groceries and supermarkets meanwhile the neighborhood bakeries usually produce biscuits and cookies that are sold on a per piece basis while the cottage or backyard producers make specialty biscuits and cookies using traditional original recipes and are normally sold personally to friends and neighbors these include companies which are also known to produce other food products directly or through their affiliates such as monde nissin corporation republic biscuit corporation rebisco and universal robina corporation urc aside from the local manufacturers there are

trade of biscuits and cookies volume in tons value in us fob for exports cif for imports national statistics office biscuit exports consistently increased from tons in amounting to usm to about tons

explained that the main concern among players focus on the rising costs of raw materials such as flour and sugar packaging materials and fuel and electricity costs another concern is the growing consumer spending for transportation and communications attributed mainly to spending on phone cards or cell phone cards which are eating into the consumers limited disposable income product research and development are also important aspects of the business given increased competition with the entry of more players and the influx of imported brands including lower priced biscuits from china the big players have their own research and development teams to comeup with new and interesting biscuits and cookies in better and attractive packaging to attract a wider range of consumers prospects players see good prospects for the industry in the next three to five years the heightened competition in the market with the entry of new local and foreign brands in the past few years is good for both players and the consumers as it sparks innovations in terms of products promotions and even pricing the countrys current economic difficulties are seen by the industry as an opportunity for growth as more consumers turn to biscuits and cookies as alternative merienda meals remember the sky flakes with various toppings commercial the influx of cheaper products does not really worry the local players much because they noticed that consumers become unreceptive to the unreasonably lowpriced imports which cause them to doubt the products quality and taste also local firms say that the shelflife is compromised and drastically reduced given the long shipping travel it goes through overall the industry expects the biscuits and cookies business to be crunchier than the past few years

the introduction of coffee which became a popular drink in the united states specialty coffee shops are said to have been popularized by starbucks coffee starbucks coffee was established in by gordon bowker jerry baldwin and zev siegl originally to sell coffee beans only the companys current business of retailing coffee beverages came about when then marketing person howard schultz currently chairman got interested in selling espresso by the cup after visiting italy initially the company tested the new business model in one of its outlets and became an instant hit despite of this success however one of the owners opposed schultzs idea of expanding the concept to all of its stores in schultz left starbucks and opened his own specialty coffee shop called il giornale by the owners of starbucks decided to sell the company to focus on a acquisition peets coffee and tea which was starbucks coffee bean supplier schultz together with other investors purchased starbucks for us million schultz eventually changed ii giornales name to starbucks coffee company starbucks currently has more than outlets worldwide with located in the philippines operated by its franchisee rustan coffee corporation in the philippines even before starbucks came in there were enterprising filipinos who had the foresight to putup specialty coffee shops the pioneers in the local industry are figaro

was a small kiosk located at the glorietta mall in makati the outlet was initially called the f store the coffee experience meanwhile started in the same mall in makati also under a different name

espresso machines fresh milk whipped cream and packaging materials table interviews with key players februarymarch according to players foreign and local alike it is easy to get suppliers for their major inputs the prevalence of suppliers which normally cater to restaurants hotels and other institutional clients has led to a situation wherein the suppliers themselves approach the companies to offer their products the critical factor among players is the coffee bean roasting formula because it is at this stage where the coffee bean releases its fullest flavor potential poorly roasted beans would yield poortasting coffee drink as such every player treats his proprietary roasting techniques and recipe as highly confidential nearly all of the foreign brands interviewed say their coffee beans prepared and packed are supplied by their parent company overseas which does the purchasing and roasting of beans bought from many popular coffeegrowing areas like indonesia east africa and latin america because of this practice the local players are seen as major supporters of the local coffee industry further their use of kapeng barako sets them apart from their foreign counterparts because the beans are said to have the following characteristics a particularly strong taste b powerful body and c a distinctly pungent odor which the popular arabica beans do not have for espresso machines majority of the foreign and local players use italian brands which they acquire through local distributors for fresh milk the players buy from various sources many purchase from wellknown milk suppliers such as alaska milk corporation consolidated dairy and frozen food corporation nestle philippines new zealand milk philippines inc and san miguel corporation for whipped cream nearly all players use imported brands distributed by local companies in the country lastly packaging materials are either sourced from affiliates overseas or from local packaging companies interestingly starbucks coffee being the industry leader requires exclusivity from its suppliers in other words their suppliers are not allowed to cater to other specialty coffee shops they can however still service hotels restaurants and other foodservice outlets while the other players do not require their suppliers to be exclusive they do not allow them to sell to other specialty coffee shops exactly

increasing population puts pressure on the cultivation of marginal land areas and results to land degradation and decline in soil production potential to maintain soil fertility and productivity and to prevent land degradation and erosion nutrients taken by crops must be replenished through the application of fertilizers fertilizers are a major cost item in philippine agriculture they increase yield and enable the country to attain sufficiency in food and agroindustrial crops fertilizers have also made crop production possible in unproductive soils these include urea complete or ammonium sulfate or and monoammonium phosphate or supplydemand of fertilizer cy volume in thousand tons supply fertilizer and pesticides authority fpa based on preliminary reports submitted by fertilizer companies sales in reached tons luzon accounted for of the inorganic fertilizer market visayas and mindanao an estimated of fertilizer sales are used for food crops principally rice and corn with the remainder mainly applied to plantation crops such as banana sugarcane and pineapple bulk of the inorganic fertilizer supply is imported the majority of the finished fertilizer grades are sourced from

philippines total tons source of basic data fpa the philippines currently has three fertilizer manufacturing plants that produce various fertilizer grades for local use and for export one is located in luzon and the other two in the visayas the fertilizers manufactured locally include single superphosphate and sulfate of potash three other chemical fertilizer plants ceased operation between the late s and early s due to uncompetitive production costs maria cristina chemical industries of the philippines and planters products some amount of ammonium sulfate is also exported to malaysia thailand vietnam pakistan and palau figure for the manufacturer of these various nutrient grades local fertilizer plants depend partly upon the use of imported raw materials such as rock phosphate anhydrous ammonia and sulphuric acid ammonium sulfate export by country of destination total tons source of basic data nso the most widely used fertilizer grades are urea and urea is mainly used as a nitrogen source while is applied as a source of both nitrogen and phosphorus in some areas and to some extent are used instead of organic fertilizer the government and some private enthusiasts and environmentalists are now into the reintroduction of organic faming organic farming is a farming system that promotes among other practices the use of organic fertilizers organic matter is an essential component of healthy soils and all sound farming practices integrate and allocate available organic materials to maintain or improve soil fertility the philippines with its agricultural based economy has a plentiful supply of organic wastes a wide variety of organic materials can be used as fertilizers such as animal manures eg livestock dung liquid manure from livestock holding facilities agricultural byproducts and processing wastes eg mudpress green manures eg grass leaves domestic wastes eg sewage and industrial wastes eg wastes from distilleries sugar refineries fish canning plants chicken manure is the standard organic fertilizer used locally although cattle and carabao manures mudpress and rice bran are also used at a lesser extent unlike inorganic fertilizers animal manures not only provide nutrients but also organic substrate vital for enhancing primary productivity within aquatic environments chicken manure is the most valuable because of its effectiveness in promoting natural food growth its availability and its ease in handling and application processed organic fertilizers processed organic fertilizers are composed of a mixture of animal manures agricultural wastes eg mudpress and limestone composted for at least a week through biological chemical and mechanical action these are usually enriched with primary and secondary nutrients and in some cases also with trace elements the product appears like soil or peat and normally contains two to six times more nitrogen phosphorus and potassium than fresh manures because animal manures are a major ingredient in processed organic fertilizers it should not come as a surprise that many of the manufacturers are located near poultry and livestock farming centers domestic organic fertilizer production in totaled tons table sales during the period amounted to tons following the trade liberalization policy and the removal of levy and other restrictions smaller companies engaged in agricultural trading were able to enter into the fertilizer market once controlled only by a few private and governmentassisted firms the marketing of fertilizers passes through three main levels namely importers manufacturers distributors and dealers all importations can only be made by fpa licensed importers and cover only products registered at the fpa as of there are about fertilizer handlers manufacturers importers repackers exporters distributors licensed by fpa the fertilizer distributors or wholesalers constitute the second level of fertilizer marketing and usually cover several provinces or an entire region they sell to dealers or outlets a few importers are also distributors themselves and this provides them with the advantage of direct market access the dealers constitute the last step of the marketing channel and are the ones in direct contact with the farmers because of the free market system most distributors also hold a dealers license and sell directly in areas where there are no dealers or in conditions where local dealers are weak or selling to plantation accounts which do not require the networking advantage offered by the dealers in many cases it is therefore difficult to draw the line between distributors and dealers imported fertilizers as finished products in bulk or in bags are discharged in major ports such as manila and poro point in luzon iloilo bacolod and cebu in the visayas and cagayan de oro davao and general santos in mindanao pricing the selling price of inorganic fertilizers is generally affected by the prevailing international market price foreign exchange rate and the local supply and demand situation as influenced by factors such as changes in rainfall pattern type of crop planted calamities and importer speculation retail prices of six major fertilizer grades are presented in table prices of fertilizers have been increasing for the past eleven years due to rising world prices and foreign exchange prices of urea had tripled from a low of pbag in to pbag in figure retail prices of all other grades had been increasing the highest jump was recorded for with the highest price of pbag in compared to pbag in average retail prices of urea and cy source conclusion fertilizers are said to impact positively on crop production they help in minimizing soil degradation particularly soil erosion while maintaining and enhancing soil fertility as a whole studies show that combining inorganic and organic sources of plant nutrients is a beneficial option for the crop and soil system and hence can be of great benefit to both farmers and the environment the increasing cost of fertilizer however continues to be a major problem by farmers today producers complain that fertilizer costs in the philippines are far higher than those in malaysia and thailand high fertilizer prices translate to higher production cost further because of high prices fertilizer use is usually below the recommended levels the production and supply of fertilizers are of vital importance to food security a prerequisite for producing the quantity and quality of affordable food is that the farming community has adequate access to fertilizers ie proximity to markets on equitable terms this requires that farmers are able to choose between various sources of supply of fertilizer grades at prices they can afford and in the

beveragewholesaleretail surveybrunei march canadian highcommission introduction background and aim of the survey the wholesaleretail survey is the first of its kind being carried out by the high commission of canada in brunei with consultation from the universitiy brunei darussalam according to the statistics provided by the canadian high commission brunei imports almost of their food requirements this indicates that wholesalers and retailers in brunei currently import a large quantity of food and beverages the data for this survey were collected using an item questionnaire which was designed by the commercial officer of the canadian high commission a list consisting of wholesalers and retailers were drawn up and the survey questionnaires were distributed to them via fax twentythree out of the companies responded to the survey the survey report will provide general information to canadian food beverage exporters who are interested in the brunei market attached is a list of potential importers in brunei whom canadian exporters may wish to contact to summarize here are the two main objectives of the present survey • to determine the types of products that wholesalers and retailers in brunei are currently importing and the type of canadian products if any • to determine whether there is a potential for expanding canadian food and beverage products into the bruneian food and beverage import market twentyfive companies were faxed a copy of the questionnaire and wr replied giving us a return rate of out of the companies were wholesalers six were retailers and the remaining five were wholesalers and retailers the table and graph below show the variation annual turnover of the companies table descriptive data food and beverages currently imported to determine the type of food products the wr surveyed are currently importing from various countries eleven food type categories were drawn up in the survey to indicate the type of products these categories are table food categories and number of wr currently importing the food category dairy products milk cheese yoghurt deli meats pasta products edible oil canola salad dressings frozen mealsdessertsvegetable confectionary chocolates candies as with food beverages that were currently imported were also surveyed categories of drinks were included in the survey beverage categories and number of wr currently importing the drink category fruit juices mineral water flavoured drinks soft drinks types of canadian products currently imported out of the wr surveyed indicated that they are currently importing some canadian food products these canadian food products are • whipping cream • edible oil • snacks • maple syrup oil juices product line expansion the wr surveyed were asked whether they have any interest in expanding into any canadian food products some wr have indicated an interest in the various food categories highest being the snacks canned meatfoodvegetable confectionary cerealhealth foods dairy products and syrupsjamsspreads categories with between eight to wr indicating an interest in importing these products from canada the table below shows the number of wr that are interested in importing the food types from canada food categories and number of wr interested in expansion of product line canned meatfoodvegetable dairy products milk cheese yoghurt syrupsjamsspreads snacks chipscrackerscookiesnuts cerealshealth foods importingdistributing canadian food and beverage products the wr surveyed were also asked whether they have any longterm objectives in terms of importing and distribution of canadian food and beverage products wholesalersretailers indicated that they would like to import directly from canada one is interested in going through hong kong five through singapore two through malaysia while three wr had no plans one wr indicated they were interested in importing through another destination though unspecified by the wr a summary of the figures is presented below although a high interest is shown from wr to import directly from canada it may not be viable and the reasons for this will be discussed below conclusions findings from the survey the present survey was carried out to determine whether there is a potential market in brunei for canadian food and beverage products from the present survey we have found that a high number of wr in brunei are currently importing a variety of food products at present canadian food and beverage products have only a small footing in the brunei imported food and beverage market the types of canadian products currently imported include french fries edible oil snacks maple syrups whipping cream and juices there is a huge potential to expand canadian products into all the food and beverage product categories that are currently dominated by produce from other countries it may also be very encouraging for canadian exporters to know that most wr that we surveyed indicated their interest in expanding into various canadian products as listed in table covering almost all of the food categories except deli meats reasons for lack of interest in this food category will be discussed later at present as reported by the canadian high commission the top food exporter for brunei is singapore followed by thailand and malaysia next on the list of importers is australia the usa and followed by europe please note that singapore appears top of the list of importers not due to production but because singapore is a transshipment center for products from other countries perhaps with the strategic planning and marketing canadian products can be introduced to compete with these food and beverage products that are currently imported only companies operating within the bruneimuara district where the capital of brunei is situated were surveyed hence figures for annual turnover of wr may be underestimated and actual figures could be higher we shall now look at some of the potential problems canadian food and beverage exporters may face when introducing their products into the bruneian market the halal issue brunei is a muslim country which adhere strictly to religious regulations towards the types of food that can be sold and consumed by the muslim population which comprise more than of the total population of brunei these regulations apply specifically to all meat products chicken beef and lamb including canned meat as well as any food products which may contain animal byproducts such as gelatin meat products that are sold in the brunei market must be halal halal food refers to meat products produced from animals that have been slaughtered and prepared according to muslim rites hence any canned meat or deli meats that are imported into brunei must have been slaughtered according to muslim rites with a halal certification please take note that this does not include the following • pork which cannot be consumed by muslims at all • seafood such as fish prawns etc which are not subject to the halal regulation and can be consumed without restrictions recently the brunei government has been very strict with nonhalal food being brought into the country it is therefore advisable for exporters to be cautious if venturing into this food category perhaps due to this reason none of the wr surveyed indicated any interest in expanding into the deli meat products however seafood products are not subject to halal regulations and therefore seafood products eg canned fish tuna prawns etc may be a potential food category that can be targeted although pork cannot be consumed by muslims there is a small market within brunei that caters to nonmuslims therefore pork products may be a potential market area where canadian products may be able to venture into competition from local and regional products canadian products may face competition from the variety of local and regional products that are available in terms of costs diversity and palatability cost may be a very important factor and these local and regional products may be more economical than canadian products which may be subjected to extra costs from shipping and tax however for the canola oil the increasing health awareness among bruneians may be an asset when marketing this food category perhaps canadian exporters could target this and perhaps through a canadian food fair educate bruneians on the health benefits of low fat edible oil from canada while at the same time marketing their edible oil products it is also important to mention that brunei is a member of the association of south east asian nations asean which encourage intraasean trade which may affect the importation of products hence products outside the asean region may be subjected to import quota which may restrict the amount of products that can be imported from other countries the favourable currency exchange may also encourage brunei to import from neighboring countries such as malaysia indonesia thailand etc which have lower currency rates than brunei currently brunei dollars are at a par with singapore dollars which has the highest rates among all the asean countries brunei dollar is approximately canadian dollar beverages it is important to note that since brunei is a muslim country there is strictly no importation of any form of alcoholic beverages at present alcohol may only be brought in for personal consumption from neighboring countries under strict quota regulations canadian beverages such as mineral water soft drinks and fruit juices may face competition from local and regional products most soft drinks are produced in the region and most are canned in brunei eg pepsi fn soft drinks importing directly from canada some of the wr surveyed indicated an interest in importing their products directly from canada perhaps this would cut shipping costs for bruneian wr by shipping direct rather than going through regional transshipment ports however the amount of canadian food and beverage products currently imported is very minimal and to ship directly from canada would be highly impractical this will only become a viable option when canadian products are imported in larger quantities suggestions from what we have found in the present survey we conclude that although the bruneian food import market is relatively small a potential market exists for canadian food and beverage products in specific food categories as listed in table more aggressive strategies such as raising awareness of the benefits of canadian products perhaps in terms of prices palatability and health issues should be adopted if a venture into the brunei market is planned at present australian products enjoy an annual marketing program via an australian food fair perhaps canadian exporters should consider such a marketing strategy which will no doubt benefit greatly by raising awareness of the specific advantages that canadian products may have over rival imported products company index company profile objective ben foods b sdn bhd nd floor qaf plaza jalan telanai bsb be brunei darussalam tel fax contact importer of food beverage

thailand relevant government policies and organizations priorities and where the industry may be heading in the years ahead biotechnology is a priority sector for thailand and as such is receiving substantial rd funding from the government rd activities are the backbone of the biotechnology customer base in thailand which is mainly restricted to governmentsponsored research organizations in addition to this general document on the biotechnology sector in thailand there are also two companion market studies that identify potential opportunities for canadian biotechnology companies on a subsectoral basis and which can be found on the canadian embassy bangkok website • the market for agriculture and food biotechnology products in thailand • the market for imported diagnostic kits in thailand sector overview the government of thailand considers biotechnology as an important sector of opportunity the government has recognized the potential value of biotechnology in helping achieve enhancements in productivity particularly in view of the tremendous importance of the agriculture and food sector to thailands economy as such the government has identified two areas that are the focus of its efforts in biotechnology • improved agricultural productivity • improvement of public health the biotechnology industry in thailand is still very much in its infancy there are several pipeline products but few have been commercialized commercial bioindustry products in thailand are first generation there are initiatives under way to stimulate the creation of a vibrant biotechnology sector in thailand these are centered on the acre science park recently completed in rangsit km from bangkok this will provide incubator units pilot plants greenhouses and accommodation as well as finance management and legal support nstda and biotec moved there in june it is hoped that this will provide the critical mass needed to attract private investors government policies in support of biotechnology the government remains the driving force of research and development in thailand university projects tend to be reactionary addressing an immediate need or problem rather than long term and strategic in total rd expenditures available to the universities in thailand amounted to approximately c million government expenditure on rd was mainly on development of agriculture forestry and fishing with lesser amounts on promotion of industrial development environment and health care over the period the government plans to increase rde funding to of the annual budget the private sector through various incentives and collaborative schemes will allocate up to of sales in rde investment in the case of biotechnology the government funds about of the research and development and directs the policy and the research agenda most of the funding for research in thailand still originates from the government private funds for research are very limited as such the availability and sufficiency of research funds are a key challenge in this area the projects include studies of dengue fever malaria the blood disease thalassaemia and rental tubular acidosis a disease causing a kidney disorder this is achieved through conducting rd projects the facilitation of transfer of advanced technologies from overseas human resources development at all levels institution building information services and the development of public understanding of the benefits of biotechnology biotec is both a granting and implementing agency the construction of a science and technology park will be completed in early and will house biotecs main laboratories including pilotplant greenhouse and incubator unit biotec is responsible for national laboratories whose major objective is to develop the capability for conducting research development and engineering in the area of genetic engineering and biotechnology the activities of the national laboratories reinforce and compliment the other major nstda objectives in supporting the rde activities of supported agencies the research programs are planned and prioritized in conjunction with stakeholders from the private sector and academia the national laboratories perform rde activities that are closer to the market preferably on demand from the industries and provide technical services to the technology users biotec at present has laboratories located at the nstda yothi building and the following are involved in agriculture • plant tissue culture laboratory • mycology laboratory • shrimp dna technology laboratory biotec also has specialized laboratories at the following universities plant genetic engineering unit kasetsart university kampaengsaen campus the major task of this institute is to coordinate the various activities of scientists from the affiliated organizations it also serves as an rd center for basic and applied research with an emphasis on economically important plants which are resistant to diseases and extreme environmental conditions microbial genetic engineering unit mahidol university the microbial genetic engineering unit is a biotechnology laboratory which focuses on the study of microorganisms it also disseminates techniques and technical knowhow to concerned parties a recent study involved the development of a new strain of bacteria capable of controlling and eliminating disease carrying insects this study includes a detailed study of a gene responsible for killing mosquito larvae the insertion of this gene in the photosynthetic bacterium a quadruplicatum and use of dna probes for detecting microorganisms are currently being investigated marine biotechnology laboratory at chulalongkorn university the main objective of this particular unit is to conduct rd in aquaculture technology and marine bioresources for industrial and medical purposes current research topics include the improvement of oyster species techniques for abalone cultivation physiological studies of spirulina spp and the hybridization of king prawn biochemical engineering and pilot plant unit at king mongkuts university of technology thonburi this specialized laboratory aims to be a centre for coordinating the activities of scholars and engineers from network institutions it also serves as a center for developing human resource capabilities in biochemical engineering eg design construction and maintenance of a pilot plant and the development of separations technology for use in the development of new products and the improvement of production efficiency medical biotechnology center at siriraj hospital mahidol university the objectives of this laboratory are to carry out rd in the application of biotechnology in health and health related areas emphasis is placed on the development of diagnostic kits for tropical diseases such as dengue and malaria cassava and starch conversion technology unit at kasetsart university the objective of this unit is to develop valueadded products from cassava and rice starch such as modified starch and high value food products bioservice unit the main objective of this unit is to provide biomolecular resources for researchers from both public and private sectors services that the unit currently provides include the analysis of biological samples using new techniques such as fluorescence activated cell sorting and capillary electrophoresis the unit also provides custom synthesized oligonucleotides dna fingerprinting unit the main responsibility of this unit is to provide support for using dna fingerprinting technology for the quality assessment of plant varieties animal breeds and food products research in related areas such as molecular marker development and genome research are also carried out following eu regulations on gmo labeling there has been a tremendous increase in demand for testing raw food materials and food products from the private sector in thailand as the only facility in the country capable of testing for gmo content the dna technology laboratory is operating at full capacity in response to the demand the unit has the capability to identify foreign genes in most organisms and food products including soya sauce patent pending with the exception of high purity oil v other players in biotechnology sector the number of private companies and research institutions active in biotechnology rd are limited most foreign companies have done little biotechnology rd in thailand having participated in the thai market through export and technology transfer activities several of the thai universities are involved in some form of biotechnology research but it is not extensive a nonexclusive listing of research work at universities is contained in table with a strong agricultural base it is not surprising that the food processing and production industrial sector are those with the keenest interest in the use of molecular biology and biotechnology for • food processing and increasing value add of products • genetic improvement of plants and livestock • evelopment of diagnostics there are around approximately companies producing locally developed diagnostics and companies producing diagnostics developed overseas • development of biological products especially for biological control in agriculture with these interests in mind and awareness of the costs involved in research industry linkages with local institutes are often on a consortium basis examples include • king mongkuts institute of technology thonburi has linkages with the algal production industry and a consortium interested in anaerobic treatment of agroindustrial waste there is a considerable amount of collaboration by thailand with foreign countries in biotechnology that is seen by thailand as an effective way of keeping abreast of developments with the least investment canada is one of these participants see table for listing scientific entrepreneurship the drive towards scientific entrepreneurship is still in its infancy in thailand and the translational infrastructure requires significant development other parties who are receptive to such investments include the nomura jafco capital co ltd which makes deals of approximately million baht main sectors of activity protecting and building its export business in agriculture and food products is of considerable concern to thailand and anything that will enhance thailands position in these markets is of interest however the regulatory framework of some of its principal trading partners particularly europe and japan restricts the adoption of biotechnology products thereby to some extent limiting thailands capability to embrace this technology local non government organizations ngos and other public interest groups have become increasingly vocal in their antibiotechnology stance on the other hand the thai government acknowledges the value of biotechnology and appears keen to embrace this technology seeing it as a means to protect smallmedium scale enterprises whose existence will be threatened when thailand opens its agrifood industry under the world trade organization agreement the government sees biotechnology as means for many of these industries to improve their products and efficiencies the interests of the agriculture and food industries in biotechnology include genetic improvement of plants livestock and aquatic species food processing to improve value added value and pest control in agriculture in the biomedical field a limited number of companies are developing andor improving imported diagnostics production of pharmaceutical agents is very limited and focuses on generic drugs the strategy for bioresearch in thailand formulated by the two main funding agencies trf and biotec involves three key elements the biodiversity research and training programme initiated in the tropical disease programme started in and the thailand postgeonomics programme research is in the initial stages and much more effort will be needed including imported technology and expertise to reach the advanced stage necessary before results can be applied commercially research projects in progress include dairy cow program the focus is on improved breeding programs and feed regimes the traditional breeding practice in thailand has been too slow to meet national requirements the importation of pregnant heifers andor young calves quality bred from abroad is too costly thai scientists are familiar with technologies such as embryo transfer in vitro fertilization embryo sexing and semen sexing however technological and economical factors are limiting the commercial potential of this work technology transfer and training of thai researchers are required if the goal of production of high quality heifer calves is to be achieved dna fingerprinting work on the identification of genetic markers for production and disease traits in livestock is being carried out at the veterinary faculty of kasetsart university this research will be used as the basis for developing diagnostic kits plant related biotechnology agricultural crop production is central to thailands success so it is therefore not surprising that this sector attracts the most research and development interest several factors act as the stimulus for this effort including improving crop yield protection of agricultural crops from diseases and pests post harvest handling and diversification of products rice biotechnology program rice yields in thailand are low another c million was spent on fungicides molecular genetic methods are now used such as dna fingerprinting of a blast isolate collection and mapping of host resistance genes • establishment of a suitable differential cultivar series • pathotype and molecular genetic characterization of the blast pathogen population in thailand there are now more than monospore isolates in the national culture collection • the potential of using thai isolates of magnaporthe grisea for development of a molecular diagnostic tool for pathogen rice analysis biotec on behalf of thailand joined the international collaboration for sequencing the rice genome icsrg thailands contribution is to sequence mb annually of chromosome for the next five years total support for this project will be c million joining icsrg will allow thai scientists to directly access the rest of the genome sequence disease markers development of bacterial wilt species is a priority in thailand presently three putative qtls corresponding to bacterial wilt have been found agriculture and gene engineering the transgenic plants are in contained greenhouses waiting fieldtesting a coat protein gene has been inserted to control papaya ring spot virus chili pepper chili veinbanding mottle virus a disruptive disease of chili peppers the transgenic plants are still in the laboratory a coat protein gene has been transformed into these plants for the control of cowpea aphidborne mosaic virus the transformation process has had more problems than in the case of other plant transformation and little progress has been made support is from the government and thailand research fund trf a pilotscale production facility for production of nuclear polyhedrosis virus bacillus thuringiensis and b sphericus has been established jointly between biotec and the department of agriculture nuclear polyhedrosis virus is widely used to control spodoptera moth in the production of grapes bacillus thuringiensis bt produced locally has gained popularity over the last few years production of the bacillus has taken up the production capacities of pilot plants at mahidol university and king mongkuts university of technology thonburi commercial production should begin in the near future these diseases have become progressively a more serious threat to the industry as it has expanded and intensified checking for subclinical whitespot syndrome virus infections by pcr is now a common practice in thailand to help farmers screen out whitespot virus post larvae before stocking a shrimp biotechnology service laboratory was established in july at biotec to summarize the reference pcr methods for shrimp viral disease detection for thai shrimp farms the objective is to serve as a reference laboratory for major shrimp pathogen diagnosis based on molecular techniques to conduct research and to provide assistance and reagents for molecular detection of various shrimp viruses an industry consortium was formed in the shrimp culture research and development company with the mandate to resolve problems common to the shrimp aquaculture industry • attempts to manipulate the gonad inhibiting hormones gih to regulate growth maturity and reproductive success of prawns food processing biotechnology has been used in baking brewing and production of traditional foods in thailand for centuries but intensive r d started only recently food biotechnology is being used to enhance food quality and extend shelf life however most of this work involves first generation biotechnology r d in this industry is intended to solve the problems of the food processing industry commercialize traditional processing systems improve raw material utilization and reduce environmental impact cassava and starch technology tapioca starch industry is one of the largest industries in thailand the program carries out rd to improve processing efficiency minimize waste and drive product diversification biomedical biomedical science is by far the strongest of the three roots of biotechnology in thailand major achievements from indigenous research in biomedical science in thailand include those on both basic and clinical aspects of tropical diseases genetics and nutrition even before the advent of genetic engineering and molecular biology thailand has already recorded many advances in these areas at the international level a rapid detection and identification of dengue viruses via polymerase chain reaction pcr has been achieved a vaccine based on attenuated dengue virus is in advanced stage of clinical trial in the area of biocontrol of mosquitoes toxin genes from bacillus thuringiensis israeliensis have been cloned and expressed from ecoli bacteria from mosquitolarva gut have been selected and transformed with the mosquitolavicidal genes from various sources the pharmaceutical market in thailand was worth about us million in the ethical market is slightly larger representing about of the total doctors are not the only ones to prescribe drugs in thailand many patients especially those not living in bangkok go to their local pharmacist for a prescription and many thais also use oriental medicines thai pharmaceutical manufactures serve mainly the domestic market and only a small number of pharmaceuticals are exported thai pharmaceutical companies have a tradition of looking for products that are no longer patent protected however an increasing number of companies are producing under license for western multinationals testing genetically modified organisms products of biotechnology are regulated at two levels national and institutional the national biosafety committee nbc was established in january institutional biosafety committees ibcs at research institutes were subsequently encouraged thailands biosafety guidelines consist of two parts those for laboratories and a second set for trials these documents are available in both thai and english language versions application for fieldtesting is sent to the director general of the department of agriculture doa moac with a copy to the nbc the nbc will after careful consideration of the proposal provide its recommendation to the doa for final consideration and approval the doa has made a ministerial declaration under the plant quarantine act that all transgenic plants are prohibited from entering the country unless permission is granted by the director general dg of doa and only for experimental purposes all relevant information and documents concerning transgenic plants nature of genes gene constructs transformation process etc has to be submitted to the doa dg with a copy to biotec as nbcs secretariat the case may be approved or rejected depending on the joint doanbc decision • flavr

florence e mojicasenior agribusiness specialistcenter for food and agri business uap the philippines is a pbillion broiler market equivalent to million kilos of chicken the market has been growing at about to per annum over the last five years small stalls and carinderias capture the rest wet markets are by far the most popular source of chicken for households supply and demand five integrators are supplying the market these integrators supply around of the total demand nonintegrators or other commercial growers are supplying the remaining from to the country imported almost eight million birds the dramatic increase in breeder chick imports in two million birds resulted in a bumper broiler output in and imports of frozen chicken come mostly from the us the country imported minimal amounts of frozen chicken in as many integrators pursued expansion activities owing to high demand as a result of the reduction of pork demand due to the fmd outbreak after the countrys accession to wto and its lifting of the quantitative restrictions in frozen imports went up dramatically in and in imports reached a new high of tons due to the massive entry of imported leg quarters from the us the current tariff for chicken meat is inquota and outquota frozen chicken importation year volume tons value us cif volume growth value growth national statistics office the philippines produces an average of tons per year with an average annual growth of chicken consumption is relatively low at kg per capita readytocook equivalent far lower than those of thailand and malaysia at kg and kg respectively as chicken is incomeresponsive the projected growth will exceed the growth in real consumption expenditures philippines bas philippines us department of agriculture the market the market will remain to be concentrated on foodservice and households both markets have distinct preferences the fastfood chains require large volume delivery mainly marinated cutups they are very strict in size and product specifications and very particular on value quality service and reliability other hri however requires primarily whole chicken and have more variable pricing as against the relatively stable prices of fastfood chains wet markets on the other hand provide the daily requirement of household purchases offering both whole chicken and cutups wholesale prices are fluctuating while retail prices at the wet markets are inelastic retailers tend to increase margin when the volume is low to provide necessary daily earnings households also buy from supermarkets and hypermarts according to an industry source around of the volume is being sold at the supermarket level supermarkets also offer housebrands ie bonus and wow which compete with the integrators brands magnolia purefoods cooks swift etc what to expect the philippine poultry industry will remain to be viable the valueadded chicken products have a large potential for growth chicken consumption is directly proportional to increases in income with the constantly growing domestic market and growth in eating out spending chicken consumption will move up there are however threats such as the entry of cheap chicken parts like leg quarters low cost of production of asean neighbors new legislation and food safety and ethnic requirements haccp gmp sps codex alimentarius iso halal which make production more costly what needs to be done the industry needs to develop and implement a road map for longterm sustainability with the objective of providing more consistent supply of healthful and affordable protein source it must strive to be efficient while the industry can produce whole chicken competitively with low tariff on corn competing with imported leg quarters is going to be a different ride at tariffs in imported chicken parts will still land cheaper improvement in productivity requires investment in new infrastructure and technology to keep at pace with our neighboring countries compliance to international quality standards is a major step that would lead to the development of the export market players should continue to implement more performancebased contract schemes with business partners or growers and raise efficiency levels through new ways of doing things greater cooperation among integrators and commercial growers is necessary as well as cooperation with other parts of the value chain for better processing storage and logistics support the key to a competitive poultry industry is production efficiency and least cost of production analysis of strengths weaknesses

imported chocolates is also a growing challenge to the local industry in a country with relatively low incomes these can dramatically affect demand in order to address these concerns the industry must improve product quality through product development new investment and increase in production efficiency thus far there have been efforts to adopt computer aideddesign and manufacturing processes including bar coding thus enhancing productivity prospects one of the competitive edges of the local manufacturers is the ability to cater to the large lowincome segment about of the million

seasoning for all seasons senen u reyessenior management specialistcenter for food and agri business uap the filipino penchant for food is none the more manifested by our festive nature despite economic difficulties we love to fiesta and party even on short notice we even use the most trivial occasions to get together and celebrate one reason for our love for food is the condiment and seasoning that go with it one would always find a match mangga at bagoong chicharon and vinegar karekare at alamang lumpia and vinegar with garlic pansit and soy sauce with kalamansi or a mix of vinegar soy sauce kalamansi with chili pepper as dipping sauce for fried grilled steamed or roasted meat fish and seafood websters third new international dictionary defines condiment in three ways one a condiment is something usually pungent acid salty or spicy added to or served with food to enhance its flavor or to give added flavor thus condiments are related to or synonymous to seasoning second it is an appetizing and usually pungent substance of natural origin as pepper vinegar or mustard third condiments are any of various complex compositions having similar qualities as curry or chili powder pickles or catsup products websters definition aptly describes the local condiments industry the wide range of products include tomato ketchup banana sauce fish sauce soy sauce vinegar salt pepper monosodium glutamate liquid seasoning broth cubes garlic ginger mayonnaise mustard sweet and sour sauce hot sauce worcestershire sauce barbecue sauce lechon sauce wasabe and food mixes most of these condiments can be used as seasoning flavoring dipping sauce preservative dressing soup stock base and marinate there are four major condiments regularly found in the filipinos kitchen and dining table fish sauce soy sauce vinegar and ketchup there are several variants to these condiments fish sauce a common condiment in asia is made from the liquid drained off by fermenting fish with salt in large barrels or vats it is locally called patis and is known as nam pla in thailand and nuoc mam in vietnam fish sauce is available in both premium quality and low grade however fish sauce is not a common seasoning in the visayas as the locals are bound to give soy sauce when one asks for fish sauce soy sauce is a salty dark colored liquid produced from a mixture of fermented soybeans and roasted grain there is light and dark soy sauce as well as a variant with kalamansi known as toyomansi available in the market vinegar from the french vin aigre sour wine is made by bacterial activity that converts fermented liquids into a weak solution of acetic acid vinegar can be made from sugarcane coconut nipa palm malt pineapple and rice it usually has a banana or tomato foundation and is available in classic original and sweet blends demand the national statistics officefamily income and expenditures survey fies revealed that in filipino households spent p billion for sauces salt and other spices and seasoning this grew to p billion in households from the ncr southern tagalog and central luzon were the leading buyers of these commodities note the survey will be released soon total spending however has not been indicative of per capita consumption as the figures were highest in the mindanao regions particularly western and northern mindanao this is more a reflection of the economic situation in mindanao where families use condiments as viand many of the countrys poorest provinces are in the area from to industry sources estimate that soy sauce had the highest average annual growth rate at followed by fish sauce and vinegar total soy sauce demand in approximated cases per day while vinegar had less than soy sauce and fish sauce less than soy sauce this excludes producers of unbranded products and fakes datu puti and nelicom have share datu puti and amihan have of the market silver swan marca piña and datu puti dominate the soy sauce market with

percentage of exports from in to in the industry however does not perceive the increased growth of imports as an immediate threat demand for imports basically come from the highend market which is only of total volume soy sauce is the countrys major export accounting for of total volume followed by vinegar it is also the leading import with of total volume exports imports exports imports vinegar and ketchup year vinegar ketchup exports imports exports banana imports tomato no imports of banana ketchup minimal exports of tomato ketchupsource national statistics office prospects the industry is characterized by the presence of many players as there are basically no barriers to entry the producers of fakeadulterated mixtures sold at cheaper prices compound this there is also minimal product differentiation the threat of imports particularly from asean competitors and the growing health consciousness away from salty and carcinogenic substances despite these negative factors it is perceived that the condiment industry will thrive in good times and in bad times it has been part of the filipinos eating habit and culture for generations in times of prosperity people are bound to eat more and eat out which will drive demand for condiments in the same way economic difficulties will still sustain demand given the peoples tendency to add more taste and flavoring to rice considering the limited budget for meat fish and vegetables the growing population of the country coupled with the demand for instant noodles is seen as positive signs for the condiment industry

perishable and very fragile thus proper harvesting packaging and handling are critical prospects despite the insufficient supply of cutflowers in the local market prospects seem gloomy due to the current economic slowdown local demand could drop because they are not a basic commodity plenty of growers are also venturing in this industry hence higher market competition for existing growers on

months our full year estimate at to in november held water this we foresee agricultural growth to fall between performance in agriculture grew by in the main growth drivers were palay coconut banana a few minor crops livestock and poultry crops palay was a growth year for rice as it posted a gain to million tons the highest level ever increased use of good seeds improved irrigation sufficient rainfall and intensive use of fertilizers brought this about rice stocks at the start of the lean months would be about m tons that translates to about days consumption at tons per day this is equivalent to the required buffer stock corn corn output was off from last year at m tons from m tons crop shifting unfavorable weather pests and other problems in the first quarter contributed to the fall in heavy wheat imports were resorted to bridge the corn shortage about m tons of wheat for food and feed was imported of which only tons was feed wheat total corn imports on the other hand reached tons for the whole year coconut after back to back weather disturbances el niño and la niña coconut production in nut terms grew over the united coconut associations of the philippines ucap on the other hand placed copra production at m tons from m tons in exports of coconut oil reached almost m tons in the increased production pulled down prices as coconut oil fell to per ton from an average of a year ago amid oversupply in the vegetable oil market this placed farmgate copra at p per kilogram the sustained decline in prices has been caused by the following record breaking harvests of rapeseed and oil palm fruits rise in global export availabilities of sunflowerseed and coconut oil ample endofseason stocks indias decision to raise import duties on vegetable oil possibility of other countries following chinas policy to favor imports of seeds over oil purchases and outlook for another abundant harvest of highoilyielding crops in sugar another factor attributed to the slow growth is the shift of sugarcane farmers to other crops particularly in tarlac sugarcane posted a positive growth in the last quarter of after consistently showing decreases in the first three quarters of the year banana production growth accelerated in to from in better weather conditions coupled with good crop maintenance and increases in bearing plants propelled growth the expanding china market also encouraged production expansions especially in mindanao which account for about of the countrys total banana production other crops representing a mixed bag of fruits vegetables and tree crops the other crops account for about a fourth of total agricultural production this group posted recovery in with growth of a big turnaround from the decline in the gainers include abaca tomato garlic cabbage eggplant calamansi cotton other fibercrops and others expansions were brought about by a combination of factors favorable weather conditions availability of planting materials and increases in area planted livestock the subsector comprising mainly hogs cattle and carabao posted a moderate growth of percent in carabao produced the highest output gain of while hog production grew by likewise dairy production was up by due to the increment in number of milking animals in cooperative dairy farms poultry poultry grew further by from the it recorded in chicken production grew by while chicken eggs production increased by as a result of increments in inventory of commercial layers fishery and aquaculture the sector grew by aquaculture and municipal fisheries were the lead gainers among the growth factors were rehabilitation of fishponds and fishcages availability and use of goodquality fingerlings increased stocking rate declaration of fish sanctuaries and dispersal of

for this revised figure is based on projected increases in palay and corn production two of the countrys major crops following higher investments in irrigation and adoption of new technologies other subsectors are expected to post increases as well palay production may be flat in due to reduced plantings with expected low rainfall in the second half rainfed areas will experience reduced yields the first semester outcome will be positive as good weather conditions still prevail the second semester will be negative in the fourth quarter with the likely el niño onset in the third an upside factor is the delay of the el niño to the fourth quarter given the june rains brought by tropical depressions darna and emong the preparedness and anticipation of the department of agriculture can also negate the effects of a mild el niño however the depreciating peso will continue to put pressure on farm incomes as input prices will stay on the high side given the beginning stock a positive production in the first half m tons rice equivalent and a day buffer stock by june the country contracted and brought in imports close to tons m landed cost last year the nfa imported a little over tons industry sources revealed that palay prices were slightly lower up to from january to april compared to the same period last year farmgate prices fell below p the main culprit was the early entry of imported rice it also claimed that smuggled rice provided additional supply and contained prices this will have dampening effects on farm income the bas estimated first quarter growth at due to favorable weather fertilization and hybrid seeds an fall in the second quarter from reduced area and yield will bring first half corn lower than a pick up in the second half will bring the full year corn growth at a growth in the first half and in the second half are likely the production growth of coconut as well as those of other vegetable oils would likely sustain the depressed world market prices the current levels exerting a downward push on farmgate prices some mills have limited operations due to a world oversupply of vegetable oils and stiff competition in shipping space to overseas destination for the first quarter of sugarcane production recovered significantly by full year growth however is expected to slow down to from last years soft export prices in japan the countrys biggest market may temper the planned expansions by banana growers in southern mindanao amid hopes over the growing china market in alone japan including okinawa absorbed about of the countrys banana exports while china including taiwan note there is now a glut in the japanese market owing to good production in mindanao and the influx of bananas from latin america which failed to sell a big chunk of its produce to the european union over tariff issues the situation is expected to cut philippine export prices of per kilogram box in the next several months production for the first quarter grew by for the whole year growth is projected at as most crops eg pineapple mango etc sustain gains posted during the first quarter increases will be brought about by improved weather conditions better market demand area expansion etc livestock livestock production grew by during the first quarter of growth is expected at moderate growth of the sector can be attributed to the slow growth in hog population due to the possible closure of inefficient farms the rising cost of production is tempering attempts to expand operations cattle output will continue to slow down due to decreasing importation and weak demand brought about by the mad cow disease scare and more so now weak purchasing power poultry for the first quarter of poultry production grew by a growth of in the first half and in the second half are likely as integrators are now into production expansion plus positive effect of mad cow the impact of industry consolidation smfi and purefoods is difficult to quantify fishery and aquaculture the sector is expected to grow by in this is an improvement from the growth in recoveries are expected from aquaculture municipal and commercial fisheries by now production growth is in the first quarter favorable weather conditions rehabilitation of sanctuaries modern equipment and technologies will facilitate production growth seaweed will still be the supply driver due to expansion in production areas and good weather our full year estimate is between is a good year quantitywise but poor pricewise especially for palay and copra rural purchasing power is down the abu sayyaf problem and the spate of kidnappings while not directly affecting agriculture are not helping the economy to recover the high foreign exchange rate continues to put prices of agricultural inputs on the high side this does not bode well for domestic and export competitiveness lets hope the incoming congress can come up with measures to address this watch out for when agricultural

or genetically altered rice is touted as a symbol of all the goodness biotech has to offer it appears unusual in that it is very pale yellow in color a sign of all the betacarotene that the inventors have managed to pack into the grains the nutrients it contains can help avoid vitamin a deficiency vad related diseases including irreversible blindness in hundreds of thousands of children yearly particularly among poor families the development of golden rice golden rice is the first research sample of vitamin enriched crop it is genetically modified containing betacarotene and other carotenoids dr ingo potrykus a professor of plant science at the swiss federal institute of technology together with his chief collaborator peter beyer of the university of freiburg in germany developed the controversial golden rice the rockfeller foundation the swiss federal institute of technology the european union under a european community biotech programme and the swiss federal office for education and science financially supported the technology used in developing this rice dr potrykus invention started with a typical strain of white rice whose embryo was added with some dna from daffodils and a bacterium the goal of dr potrykus when he used genetic engineering to improve rice nutritional content was to fight the growing rate of malnutrition especially of people who depend on rice as their major staple it was also intended to lower the risk degree of vad and the health problem that result from it at the local front philrice supervising science research specialist thelma padolina indicated that we will be using golden rice in incorporating our breeding program but for sure we will be following the guidelines of the national biosafety committee according to her biotechnology is a tool for plant breeding and she has a positive stand about this because it is one way to avert hunger and to become selfsufficient philrice has grains of this transgenic rice transferred through a memorandum of agreement by irri and dr potrykus the institution is now conducting studies using golden rice as parental material for breeding and to hybridize other rice varieties some constraints prevent golden rice from being readily acceptable here in the philippines one it is not adaptable to our climate because it is a japonica type of rice which is mostly grown in temperate countries like japan and the second is because of the very rigid multilocation testing necessary before it can be approved as a variety biochemical components as discussed earlier rice grains do not contain betacarotene but scientists recently identified the biochemical pathway required in the production of betacarotene in the rice endosperm the edible part of the grain geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ggpp which is the only known precursor substance available in the rice endosperm is where the process starts however the ggpp still cannot be converted into betacarotene because the enzymes needed in this process are not inherently available in the rice so dr potrykus and his team introduced foreign genes that will encode these enzymes and make them work in synchrony the group genetically modified the taipei rice variety with two genes from daffodils and a gene from the bacterium erwinia uredovora was introduced to complete the pathway the product was genetically modified rice that produced pale yellow colored kernelscourtesy of betacarotene accumulation health benefits vs hazards in rice eating populations malnutrition is said to be high in the philippines for instance national estimates on the prevalence of malnutrition in among preschoolers and schoolchildren revealed the following years old below years old absolute figure absolute figure moderately food and nutrition research institutedepartment of science and technology various deficiencies including zinc vitamin c and d folate riboflavin selenium and calcium occur in the context of poverty environmental degradation lack of proper education and social disparity these underlying issues can never be addressed by golden rice vitamin a deficiency is the cause of blindness of seventeen filipino children everyday maternal night blindness which is a symptom of vad also afflicts of laborers and unskilled workers and of farmers forestry workers and fishermen in the developing world vad is responsible for cases of irreversible blindness every year it is also the leading cause of child death diarrhea measles and pneumonia about million children worldwide have vad poor families particularly in asia consume rice as a staple babies are often fed on rice gruel unfortunately the grains of rice lack betacarotene which is the source of vitamin a it is present in the leaves and stem but none in the grain endosperm and no amount of traditional breeding has been able to get it there vitamin a supply where rice is a staple source wwwgraincom in an interview dr potrykus said if some people decide that they want blind children and white rice its their choice im offering the possibility of yellow rice and no blind children offering the golden rice seeds for humanitarian purposes was not as easy as dr potrykus thought it would be the golden rice has caused many speculations from environmental campaigners who continue to reject modern biotechnology researches and products of genetic engineering golden rice is fools gold this is the greenpeace groups belief because of the risk involved that still cannot be properly assessed at the present state of scientific knowledge antigm activists oppose any release of gmos into the environment according to environmental campaigners if we allow this golden rice and depend on it for nutrition an adult would need to eat kilograms of dry rice roughly kilograms of cooked rice for daily requirement of vitamin a children around the world would also lose knowledge of the importance of other crops such as green leafy vegetables allergenicity has also been raised as a possible issue daffodil is responsible for an allergic reaction which manifest as daffodil pickers rash in some people conclusion while many doubt the ability of golden grain to eliminate vitamin a deficiency we need more answers to the question raised by antigm activists we need to ensure the grain is freely available and acceptable to the poor golden rice is not produced to supply all the vitamin a we need for a day it is meant to supplement which only means that we should have other sources of vitamin a in our diet to meet the daily requirement you cannot expect people to eat rice alone so this should never be considered as a substitute a spread of the peanut butter industry ronald mark g omañaresearchercenter for food and agri business uap at the thought of the word peanut one would not miss mentioning the legumes most popular use as peanut butter peanut butter is one of the many products that fall under the bread spreads category other wellknown spreads include butter cheese spreads jams jellies and marmalades sandwich spread and mayonnaise like the other spreads peanut butter is normally added to ordinary bread to give it a distinct and specific flavor at times it is used in baking and also in cooking to create savory sauces for various vegetable meat and pasta dishes peanut butter is made from roasted peeled and ground peanuts mixed with sugar salt and oil history the origin of peanut butter can be traced back in when american physician george a bayle jr experimented by grinding peanuts to produce ground nut paste intended as a nutritional protein substitute for people with poor teeth peanutbutterloverscom since then peanut butter has been used in the united states but it was only in when it was introduced to the world market according to the us national peanut board peanut butter had its first world exposure at the universal exposition in st louis through ch summer the product received

nearly in to tons us before expanding by to tons us in volume fell again in to tons us and increased by in to tons us peanut butter philippine trade imports exports national statistics office nso over the last five years total imports reached tons worth us million major sources were the united states of volume followed by china indonesia and canada the united states was the leading supplier of

butter worth us in volume declined by to tons after expanding by more than three times to tons in from only tons in value of shipments overseas also dropped by to us from us in it was also lower by compared to the value in of us the leading country buyers in were the united states of volume followed by italy australia and japan each and kuwait the consistent leading buyer during the fiveyear period was also the united states with purchases totaling us about seven times bigger the value purchased by italy for the same period currently a substantial percentage of total peanuts used are imported usually from china because they are cheaper and have relatively low moisture content according to a major player his company uses locally produced peanuts while the remaining is imported local peanuts albeit tastier and with better aroma cannot be completely relied on because of their high moisture content players are critical about the moisture content of peanuts because a high moisture level will cause molds to develop allowing the growth of a carcinogenic substance called aflatoxin sources say the entire spreads industry also suffers from slow movement in supermarkets and groceries this makes the peanut butter industry specifically more vulnerable to the new and more affordable spreads that have entered the market with this and the changing breakfast food patterns from bread with spreads to the more convenient and varied instant nocook noodles porridges biscuits and cookies peanut butter stands to lose its hold on its market prospects the market for peanut butter has remained relatively steady in the past years the entry of breakfast substitutes like instant noodles however have led companies to be more creative players have learned to address consumer demand and preference for more nutritious and healthier foods by fortifying their products with vitamins a b d and e another is the introduction of peanut butter with stripes of chocolate and fruit jams like guava and grape notably from unilever bestfoods and since bread and spreads go handinhand another hope for the peanut butter industry is the expected growth the bread industry will post in the medium term packaging is also a potential growth consideration store checks revealed that peanut butter substitutes like sandwich spreads mayonnaise and cheese spreads have been enjoying tremendous sales after manufacturers particularly unilever bestfoods and kraft introduced these in smaller retail packs at a cheaper cost reports say unilever is positioning its marketing strategy towards the mass market this strategy clicked with its shampoos in sachets and is expected to enjoy the same success in its mayonnaise sandwich spread and the recently launched bestfoods say cheez cheese spread in sachets it would not be a bad idea if peanut butter producers adopt a similar scheme and experiment by introducing peanut butter in sachets currently the smallest peanut butter available is in gram containers institutional users could also be tapped to widen the spreads market jams jellies and marmalades have been successful in this part a leading player revealed that part of his companys growth plans is tapping tollpackers and entering into private labeling agreements with supermarkets and food stores what the industry needs is to maintain producing high quality peanut butter coupled with a little marketing push the development of more varieties and a touch of advertising could definitely help it compete with more popular spreads francisco carol grace a research paper submitted to the

this industry brief is being made available to canadian businesspeople in order to provide basic market information should there be export interest in relevant agrifood commodities the growing industry of private labels ronald mark g omañaresearchercenter for food and agri business uap a visit to a major supermarket chain would show private label products alongside wellknown brands the goods are usually offered at lower prices and consumers cannot help but take a second look what are private label products private label products also known as inhouse or store brands are products that carry a stores name as its brand or another name owned by the store they usually cover food and nonfood categories the labels are simple usually twocolored and the selling prices are relatively lower private labels often occupy huge and prominent spaces inside supermarkets beginnings in the philippines the pioneer and the leader in retailing private label products is supervalue inc operator of the sm supermarket chain supervalue uses the sm bonus brand in other countries like the united states private labels started at about the turn of the century its popularity however dwindled when national brands ie goods that are sold in almost all stores utilized advertising to promote their products during the early s private labels clicked as consumers preferred cheaper products they were known then as generics ie low quality products packaged in minimalist wrappings fiery foods barbeque business magazine the s saw a renewed interest in national brands but this time private label product retailers responded by improving on quality a few even made the extra step of offering premium private labels to compete with national brands quality and pricewise owing to zero advertising expense the united states department of agriculture usda estimated that in one of every five products bought in supermarkets in the us is a store brand further a recent report by the private label manufacturers association based on a survey made by gallup organization revealed that there is a high consumer acceptance of store brands compared to previous surveys more consumers are buying store brands and the frequency of purchase has also increased in europe while there are no available information on how private labels started these products enjoy a relatively high acceptance rate among consumers a survey conducted by ac nielsen in revealed that in the united kingdom of total retail market is composed of private label product sales by volume in belgium the share is followed by germany the netherlands and france on top of the list of the most saleable products were pasta poultry and fruits and vegetables private label retailers the big supermarkets in the country offer their

supermarket was opened in the s and its private label line was introduced practically during the same time currently supervalue inc has a total of supermarkets nationwide sm bonus is the leading private label in the country today no other store brand has matched the number of products the label covers be it in food or nonfood at the time of its introduction it had around items with nearly half allocated to food today sm bonus carries more than items about of which are food products among the food items the most saleable are canned goods rustan supermarkets is owned by the tantoco

vegetable oil in tin can kg supersavers sure buy datu puti cook best marca piña supermarket survey for the budget conscious consumer these price differences matter especially amid the hard economic times however while retail prices play an important role in consumer decision making the quality and taste of private labels will still be a significant deciding factor in patronizing these products government regulation according to a retailer aside from permits from the department of trade and industry the government through the department of healths bureau of food and drugs requires them to secure a permit to sell food products under their own labels this is on top of the license given to food manufacturers that are tapped to supply the food items to assure the consumers that the products are of high quality and are safe for human consumption prospects in the united states and europe the industry of private label products is very much advanced compared to the philippines us supermarkets are extending to perishables dairy meats produce bakery convenience food and home meal replacement menus the usda expects the following categories to be occupied by private label products functional foods dairy breakfast food soft drinks pet food organic and natural foods convenience foods fullfat full flavored foods and dietary supplements in europe premium items are also being used as avenues of private label product expansions such as organic foods chilled meals including ethnic meals meat and fish dishes herbs sauces and other ingredients that are packaged with the meals salads and healthy and functional foods in the philippines there are also a lot of opportunities according to a local retailer the future of private label products looks promising more and more items are expected to be included to the growing list of food and nonfood commodities under store brands while the sm bonus brand is way ahead of the pack given the sizeable line of items it covers this still creates opportunity for others to follow the other private label retailers can still catch up and expand the coverage of their own brands the main selling point of private labels is usually their price amid the economic difficulties there is obviously a growing opportunity given the poverty incidence of nearly in out of the countrys population of million as an industry source explained these kinds of items are aimed at attracting the masses or the masa also opportunities abound especially in food products since more than half of the filipino families income is spent on food alone based on the family income and expenditure survey of the national statistics office total expenditure on food was higher at p billion compared to p billion in this comprises nearly of the total family expenditure of p trillion in with rising prices and declining consumer purchasing power the fate of private label products will rely heavily on its ability to follow the name of the game that is to

financial crisis in the industry was greatly affected by the depreciation of the peso and other economic and political factors however it is still among the countrys main exports and a good source of the muchneeded dollar earnings the philippines a tropical country boasts of fruits that are abundant during peak months this situation makes it conducive to processing or preserving fruits due to its low prices once processed fruits are made available even during offseason especially in areas where supply may be limited or where the fruits are not available at all the processed fruit industry can be divided into three categories preserved or prepared fruits fruit juices purees and concentrates and dried or dehydrated fruits preserved or prepared fruits are used in salads or served as deserts

to adhere with international standards as specified by the food and agriculture organizationcodex alimentarius commission the effective tariff rate for jams marmalades and jellies range from to in key concerns a major concern of the fruit spreads industry is the inconsistent supply of raw materials the seasonality of fruit production prevents the industry from boosting its capacity as the production schedule is more often than not dictated by the fruits in season poor roads and high freight costs also hinder the movement of raw materials from source to processing plants other constraints include the high prices of major raw materials like sugar packaging and preservatives meanwhile fruit spreads are also not very popular with the children because of the other bread fills available in the market instead of purchasing fruit spreads mothers either buy bread with fillings or bread with peanut butter or liver spread which are a lot cheaper than fruit spreads aside from the competition within the same category fruits spreads are also outdone by the other substitute goods like biscuits cookies instant noodles rice porridge etc in the supermarkets fruit spreads occupy only a minor portion of the shelf because of slow movement another hitch is the constant changes in regulations and market conditions in other countries that put the industry in a disadvantage the fluctuations in trade may be brought about by changing conditions in the international market prospects according to industry players the fruit spreads industry registered steady growth in the last few years unfortunately they sense a high probability of the market going down recently sales have not been doing well in supermarkets fruit spreads are not given good positioning because of slow movement considering also that not many people consume breakfast at home because of the changing demands of their working environment the overall bread fill category does not have new markets the industry is simply trying to maintain its existing market further it is more expensive to eat bread during breakfast than instant noodles and porridges this is why the substitutes like biscuits instant noodles and instant porridges are rapidly eating a bigger slice of the breakfast market aside from the price advantage substitutes are also more convenient because they are ready to eat however the institutional market is an area that manufacturers can explore more in there was an expansion in imported jellies attributed to the increased demand by the institutional market there is also a need to have some product development and promotion to increase demand and consumer awareness of fruit spreads all in all the market is bearish but manufacturers have high hopes for the industry fruits spreads are becoming less popular as replaced by the more convenient products and more affordable ones however there are still some untapped markets as logistics improve there is always room also for new products in totally new markets with the proper technology and government support hopefully with joint efforts by the private sector and the government the fruit spreads market in the country will expand and become more popular such a sweet thing to waste the processed fruits industry in bloom food and agri business papers no department of trade and

average volume growth was around from to brought about by rapid urbanization and growth of young population local producers supply about of domestic demand their products are priced relatively lower than imported confectionery products the latter however is slowly increasing its market share sugar confectionery products dominate especially in the rural areas this is because candies are classified

input costs particularly sugar imports have surged for confectionery products during to the weak linkage of the two sectors hinders the industrys development further the influx and preference for imported confectionery are a challenge to the local industry prospects how will the industry keep its sweet disposition one of the competitive edges of the local manufacturers is their ability to cater to the large lowincome segment with lowpriced retail packs the expanding and diverse product lines of candies and chewing gums better distribution networks increasing young population and strong marketing are also key factors that will drive demand over the next few years however growth could be moderate to annually in the next five years due to weak purchasing power industry competition will continue to be intense new product innovations will include low fat products sugarless sweets and functional sugar confectionery ie fortified with vitamins as well as new brand introductions that can sell in the domestic and export markets in addition manufacturers will seek to further widen the distribution networks to include the hotel restaurant and institutional hri sector hardware shops and other high traffic places where impulse buying opportunities can be present meanwhile the penetration of high quality imported confectionery products pose as a threat to the local industry the

dominated by multinational companies these include unilever bestfoods inc formerly california manufacturing company inc ladys choice and bestfoods brands kraft foods phils inc kraft and mccormick foods corp mccormick while these firms lord it over the spreads industry a local company is trying to gain a niche in the lucrative market with his technical knowledge and understanding of the business mr tiu along with a partner invested p million and leased a square meter facility within the governmentowned food terminal complex and techno foods inc was born being a new entrant and a very small company techno foods struggled during its first years we have very limited resources and i am fighting multinational companies kraft foods and unilever bestfoods they are the giants and i am just a nobody explained mr tiu people he knew were even skeptical and told him his business would last for only six months techno foods initial products included mayonnaise salad dressing and sandwich spreads in consumer glass bottles milliliters ml and ml and institutional plastic packaging ml using the rogers brand mayonnaise is an emulsion which is a mixture of two liquids oil and water that normally cannot be combined an emulsifier like egg yolk is used to bind the ingredients and prevent them from separating oil content in mayonnaise is set at a minimum of of total weight meanwhile

spices and flavorings mayonnaise salad dressing and sandwich spread are stable products according to mr tiu the shelf life can range from months to one year production does not require refrigeration or call for any other special machinery in fact techno foods uses locally fabricated equipment from an initial daily production of to gallon cases in techno foods now produces to gallon cases despite the increase mr tiu explains that it is just half of the plants total production capacity sixty to sixtyfive percent of production is devoted to the manufacture of mayonnaise which is the companys topselling product it also has distributors in other parts of the country its products are also sold in small groceries and stores in metro manila the company has also private labeling agreements with isetann supermarket and the cls supermarket chain in pangasinan mr tiu proudly revealed that recently he has closed a deal with supervalue inc operator of the sm supermarket chain to produce spreads for its sm bonus brand mr tiu boasts that his rogers brand has already edged kraft in divisoria because of lower selling price and comparable product quality it is now competing with bestfoods and ladys choice a price survey conducted in a grocery in pasig confirmed that the rogers brand is priced lower than the popular brands kraft bestfoods and ladys choice table on a per milliliter ml basis rogers mayonnaise was only centavos compared to centavos for kraft and bestfoods ladys choice mayonnaise was the most expensive at centavos data not available for mccormick salad dressing meanwhile was centavosml followed by kraft centavosml and bestfoods centavosml concluding remarks techno foods success in establishing prominent presence for its products in the divisoria market did not come easy it encountered problems in procuring raw materials like eggs some local suppliers required cash payments there were also difficulties in collecting payments from supermarkets and burger stands which take more than four months according to mr tiu a small company like his cannot survive without cash mr tiu believes that there is a bright future for his business he added that if there would be distributors willing to finance techno foods would not hesitate to put their products on the shelves of major supermarket chains since his production plant has the capacity to supply a bigger demand in the next five years techno foods targets more production for private labels mr tiu considers quality and price as his advantage costs are kept at the minimum since he and his partner personally attend to the daily operations of the company and the small production staff for this year the company expects sales to decline by about because of the decreased production due to low uptake and collection problems with supermarkets however it hopes to bounce back in references interview with rogelio tiu president techno foods incwwwhowstuffworkscomwwwepicuriouscom an analysis of agriculture

subsectors and industries contributed to agriculture growth in the decade in general and in in particular it will delve into the many causes of underdevelopment of agriculture which are discussed in

datasource world bank growth amid the already poor performance what were the drivers and downers agriculture grew faster to and respectively in and the main drivers were fisheries poultry and livestock interestingly these sectors were mostly demanddriven contributions to growth where did the growth come from which subsector contributed to the growth in the s and early s the analysis below shows the growth sources in expansion was fuelled by the noncrop subsectors which together contributed about of growth poultry gave livestock and fisheries what were the leaders and the laggards of the crops subsector the leaders were rice mango banana and sugarcane the laggards corn coffee garlic onion tobacco and abaca in and noncrops remained the heaviest contributors the leaders in the crops were mango rice banana sugarcane and garlic strategic implications the overall agriculture portfolio is not doing well poultry livestock and fisheries had been consistent drivers of agriculture growth since they were mostly demanddriven a key support would be access to competitively priced inputs aquaculture needs more resource flow given its high potential for gains if growth in these subsectors are stymied the whole agriculture growth will suffer and in turn the total economy too it is claimed that • public spending is not adequate the afma which was passed in provides for an additional p billion b budget for agriculture on top of the regular da budget in the first two years of implementation and pb in the next five years the afma requirements were only partially met • efficiency of public investments money has mostly been spent on areas with low returns but are politically popular eg rice • management and delivery of support services have been hampered because of the local government code which devolved extension and delivery of agricultural services to the local government units the law has to be revisited we need to adopt the seedtoshelf approach in order to enhance the competitiveness of agriculture developing agriculture makes a lot of business sense today a large chunk of the rural sector are outside the marketing loop of consumer goods firms consumers there

countries in terms of per capita consumption the sector is threatened by the perception that chicken eggs cause high cholesterol levels this idea has thwarted the local demand of table eggs also it is

privatized into the maynilad water and manila water however it was probably only in the last years when intensive campaigns were started to clean wastewater and provide safer drinking water the s saw the proliferation of gadgets and equipment to purify water this was largely due to the inability of public water utilities to service a considerable part of urban areas much less the rural areas the deteriorating condition of water distribution lines also contributed to the popularity of water purifiers water purifier brands such as homemaster sanyo imarflex aquagard and tupuro entered the market

while christmas falls during the latter part of the year nsofies cocacola bottlers inc is the countrys traditional leader in softdrink production and distribution pepsi cola products phils inc has been a distant follower cosmos bottling corporation is believed to be second to cocacola cosmos has been aggressively eating market share the market for softdrink is quite price sensitive as evidenced by the success of cosmos low price strategy to steal market share in the s la tondeña distillers inc is currently the largest fruit juice producer in the country by its acquisition of sugarland

sunkist zesto corporation sunglo concentrates d international mango d marina sales inc katas canned del monte phils inc the market for bottled water has been the fastest growing segment in the

the market other food commodities other food commodities include sugar products eg candies and chocolates sauces eg mayonnaise catsup soy sauce fish sauce etc other spices and seasoning eg black pepper vinegar garlic ginger msg etc and cooking oil aggregate household spending on sugar products stood at pb in the same level as of total family spending on sauces grew by to pb in household expenditure on other spices and seasoning totaled pb in from pb in aggregate spending on cooking oil stood at pb in conclusions several conclusions can be drawn about the philippine packaged food industry few dominate the various categories say two to four players for example ice cream softdrinks milk and meat and only one for coffee with nestle cornering of the market if there happens to be more players only a handful corner the majority of the market share the rest remain as marginal players ie bottled water chicken etc those that reflect very strong demand growth of and over are ice cream fruit juices and bottled water meanwhile the rest softdrink milk and others reflect slower growth of less than the threat of foreign imports is high and is seen to further intensify once the tariff takes effect in imports of canned meat products ie luncheon meat and corned beef have significantly grown since the s with the opening up of the market competition with local producers may bring down prices and could increase household consumption overall the packaged food industry is set to benefit from increasing disposable incomes on the back of higher economic growth principal markets would continue to be the middle and upper consumer groups accounting for of the population as lifestyle changes demand for convenience proliferates among more working women with fastpaced lifestyles leading to increasing demand for packaged foods improvement in the distribution system also contributes significantly to higher sales even in far flung areas market informationsoutheast

only on volume and on value the figures are lower compared to the growth rates registered in the previous years local vegetable growers however are complaining the reason they noticed a slowdown in the trading of their products especially in july and august of last year the culprit the increasing incidence of smuggling of vegetables and other agricultural products like fruits meat etc into the country despite the low tariffs on imports the smuggled vegetables said to be coming from china taiwan and australia include broccoli lettuce carrot cabbage cauliflower celery potato and mushrooms these are locally known as baguio vegetables la trinidad benguet and mountain province are the countrys leading producers of the socalled baguio vegetables according to mayor fongwan of la trinidad benguet official figures from the department of agriculture da on imported vegetables are understated for instance from july to october the da estimated vegetable imports to have reached only tons while a la trinidad task force indicated the volume of smuggled vegetables have amounted to tons philippine daily inquirer november in a meeting of the national agriculture and fishery council nafc subcommittee on fruits and vegetables last february the smuggling of agricultural products into the country was discussed eden dandal of the bureau of customs boc cited that smuggling rose by more than after the termination of the contract with society general d surveillance an international organization which among others preinspects in all points of origin agricultural goods for export to the philippines further in a more recent nafc meeting the customs intelligence and investigation service ciis of the boc reported that as of june this year they have apprehended nine container vans of vegetables worth about p million three of the container vans contained carrots with estimated worth of p million and six had onions valued at p million the shipments were either abandoned or did not possess the necessary import permit from the bureau of plant industry bpi the consignees were magnificent touch commercial and asia golden sun inc for the carrot shipments and carls international traders pine trade international services and asia golden luck inc for onions just recently the boc has also apprehended four container vans of carrots and two container vans of ginger from china in addition the ciis also reported that they have condemned container vans of vegetables last may these were abandoned shipments containing rotten vegetables which have been at the ports for about months to a year already why the influx of imported vegetables the main contributory factor is the reduction in tariff rates other reasons include the changing landscape for fresh produce marketing as well as increased demand for the products the rise in imports is attributed mainly to the reduction in tariffs brought about by the wto tariffs on most freshchilled vegetables have gone down to to in with the exception of a few products namely garlic onions shallots and cabbages whose tariffs are at table tariffs on imported fresh vegetables hs code description revisions potatoes fresh or chilled seeds onions shallots garlic leeks and other alliaceous vegetables fresh or chilled onions and shallots leeks and other alliaceous vegetables cabbages cauliflowers kohlrabi kale and similar edible brassicas

fresh or chilled globe artichokes mushrooms and truffles fruits of the genus capsicum or of the genus pimenta spinach new zealand spinach and orache spinach other prior to issuance of eo based on eo dated april source tariff and customs code of the philippines amid the influx of cheap vegetables especially from taiwan china and australia however local vegetable growers filed a petition with the department of agriculture da for an increase in vegetable tariff rates from mostly to thus on april malacañang issued executive order eo no modifying the nomenclature and the rates of import duty on various products under section of the tariff and customs code of presidential decree no as amended under the eo tariffs on most vegetables were increased to to the approved rates were lower than what was petitioned because higher tariffs may push prices up and further encourage smuggling imported vegetables are said to be cheaper by about compared to locally produced ones business world january further imports are better packaged especially those coming from australia which makes them more attractive to supermarkets domestic producers however claim that the countrys vegetables are better tasting and more nutritious further some companies turn to imports to provide them with yearround supply of a wider variety of vegetables changing landscape for fresh produce marketing in the past fresh vegetables and other fresh produce are sold mainly in the wet markets now supermarkets food chains hotels and restaurants airline food service providers have emerged as important buyers many supermarkets eg sm rustans robinsons now have a fresh section offering products ranging from meat fish fruits and vegetables to ensure a yearround supply of a wider variety of quality fresh products imports are brought in meanwhile rapid urbanization and fastpaced lifestyles have increased the incidence of eating out and thus have also boosted demand for fresh produce by the food service sector increased demand consumption of fresh vegetables has also expanded partly because of increased exposure in supermarkets restaurants and hotels in fact a number of large hotels and supermarkets have started to directly import fresh vegetables to ensure reliable supply of quality vegetables in addition rising incomes and increasing health consciousness among consumers are expected to further boost demand these are the very reasons why farmers have pushed for higher tariffs and a tighter watch on smuggling it is a good thing that malacañang heeded the call of farmers for higher tariffs on vegetable imports it is also good that the da through the bpi in coordination with the boc has intensified efforts to curb smuggling by tightening inspection procedures and import permit issuance in other countries quarantine inspection is the first line of defense against imported fruits and vegetables which do not comply with their sanitary and phytosanitary requirements thus the nafc came up with a resolution urging the bpi to implement mandatory quarantine inspection of all imported fruits and vegetables in coordination with the boc according to the boc such is already being done further the da and the department of finance also plans to recommend the issuance of an eo to penalize smuggling of agricultural products but much remains to be done to make the local vegetable industry competitive the supply chain must be addressed for instance there is need to enhance production technologies to further increase supply and improve quality there is need to develop marketing infrastructure eg cold chains and packing houses to lessen postharvest losses farm to market roads to lower transportfreight costs etc overall there is need to continue improving on cost quality supply reliability appropriate product innovation and customer service which are the very attributes of competitiveness market informationsoutheast asia a peek into the philippine convenience store industry ronald mark g omañaresearchercenter for food and agri business university of asia and the pacific the food retailing industry encompasses a wide range of sellers from the sarisari stores sidewalk vendors wet and dry markets to the groceries supermarkets hypermarts and warehouse and discount clubs along this scale of retailers is the modern version of sarisari stores known as convenience stores they are usually open hours a day days a week another unique feature is its promotion of selfservice on fastfood items history the convenience store concept was introduced in the philippines in by local company philippine seven corporation psc when it bought the license to put up the popular american convenience store eleven since it set foot in the country eleven has maintained its dominant position in the industry it took a long period before another cstore opened shop in uniwide holdings incorporated established its own cstore chain under the brand name uniwide family stores it was a virtual threat until it encountered financial difficulties in forcing it to sell its outlets to imart international corporation the same firm bought the aboitiz groups entry into the industry the super stores imart redeveloped the acquired stores and turned them into cobranding set up a convenience store and a pharmacy in one outlet as of end imart has stores all located in metro manila another cstore named easy mart managed to establish about stores also in metro manila in early imart and easy mart announced their stores closure industry sources say the two cstores could not sustain their operations due to financial difficulties the floro family in the mids brought into the country the franchise for the ampm convenience stores the stores have also ceased to operate towards the end of the period the holding company mateo management group mmg also entered the industry with its mmg cstores in but shut down operations early this year gas marts or cstores in gasoline stations meanwhile clicked following their establishment in major road networks such as the north and south expressways gas marts differ from the traditional cstores in terms of location and target customers the traditional cstores cater primarily to the nearby communities and transient people while gas marts target the motorists key players eleven is owned by listed firm philippine seven corporation it is the industrys market leader psc is majoritycontrolled by the president chain store corporation of taiwan since following the effectivity of the retail trade liberalization act allowing foreign companies to invest in retail firms the president chain store corp is also a eleven licensee in taiwan mini stop is owned and operated by robinsons convenience store inc a joint venture between the gokongwei family of the robinsons chain of department stores and supermarkets and mitsubishi corp and mini stop co ltd of japan the companys first cstore was opened in bingo launched in bingo is owned by jollimart philippines corporation formerly a whollyowned company by the group behind fastfood industry leader jollibee foods corporation jfc until it sold of the company to retail magnate henry sy of the sm group of companies in mercury drug superstores are owned and operated by the mercury drug corporation these stores are normally located beside the companys drug stores with the exception of mercury drugs superstores all the other cstores are operating on a hour basis and are all located in luzon in addition the superstores do not sell fastfood products and focus only on medicines and health products the hortaleza familys hbc tried for some time the cstore concept by combining food and beauty products but decided later on to just focus on its tried and tested business of retailing only beauty products another player is tropical hut fastfood chain owner manuel ques q convenience stores with three branches in metro manila gas marts meanwhile were pioneered by shell philippines inc in with its shell select stores in its gas stations its competitors caltex philippines and petron corporation followed suit with star mart and treats cstores respectively the entry of new players in the petroleum retailing industry in the late s further expanded the number of cstores such as seaoils palamig and total petroleums la botique key players in the cstore industry cstore brand company no of outlets as of end caltex star mart caltex philippines imart imart international corporation bingo e estimateceased operations in exclusive of imart and easy mart outlets source demand drivers the industry has gone a long way from its beginnings in the s while no estimates are available on the total value of the cstore industry psc alone the market leader has registered revenues of p billion in up by from p billion in the figure however was lower by compared to its sales performance in amounting to p billion see figure philippine seven corporation revenues source considering these it is important to know how the spending on food and beverages has been doing for the past years according to the family income and expenditure survey fies of the national statistics office nso household spending on food reached p billion in up by from p billion in the entire luzon region where the cstores are mostly located accounted for of total family expenditure on food equivalent to p billion in in the regions household food expenditure was at p billion representing of the countrys total spending on food personal consumption expenditure pce on food and beverages in meanwhile reached about p billion from p billion in from to the average annual growth rate was about total personal consumption expenditure pce and pce on food and beverage source national statistical coordination board another important demand driver is the countrys growing population based on the nsos census of population there are million in filipinos in with expansion rate of million personsyear the number would be reaching about million this population for luzon as of reached about million increasing number of people in urban areas indicates a growing market for cstores the fies also reported rising total household income from p billion in to p billion in luzon was the biggest income producer in the country accounting for of total income for both periods visayas share stood at while mindanao captured in other demand drivers for cstores include expanding number of working women with modified lifestyles the fastpaced lifestyles among working people in the urban areas and the roundtheclock convenience that cstores provide to customers that need to make emergency shopping trips at any time of the day store success factors location is a very important factor for success cstores usually locate in areas with high foot traffic thus players have started to invade office buildings malls as well as the lrt and mrt stations store layout also matters as the overall look and feel of the outlets affect customer count pricing and marketing strategies are also important tools because players also have to compete and keepup with the prices of goods sold in other cstores markets supermarkets and groceries industry sources say value meals or combo meals are now a must for any cstore as customers have been observed to be more attracted to purchase these especially with the declining peso purchasing power further promotion of the cstore concept is another key consideration players perceive that many people still prefer buying from sidewalk vendors and the traditional sarisari store rather than from cstores lastly a must for cstores is to have an efficient distribution and logistics system considering its significant effect to its pricing and marketing strategies prospects players expect the industry to flourish more in the next five years primarily because the country is not yet saturated with cstores particularly luzon currently cstores number only a little over with main concentration in metro manila and in other parts of luzon in the united states there are more than outlets as of in taiwan eleven alone operates more than branches while mini stop operates outlets in japan and korea players do not yet see the need to set up cstores in the visayas and mindanao moreover they have yet to study the logistics requirements and constraints before expanding outside the luzon area the high cost of settingup an outlet is also pushing the players to tap on franchising to fuel their expansion plans it was estimated that a square meter outlet would require about p million to build and furnish eleven at present has five franchised outlets while mini stop recently announced targets of putting up more than stores by the end of of which would be coming from franchisees jollimarts bingo is expected to offer franchises within the year a study conducted by research firm ac nielsen on retail trade in the asiapacific cited that modern store formats are fast replacing traditional stores in the region including the philippines sarisari stores face rationalization unless they carry more product lines to attract more customers cstores without a doubt are here to stay despite the closure of imart and easy mart the aggressive plans of new entrant mini stop will surely perk up the competition expanding

supply of marine products and the availability of low cost labour represents an opportunity for canadian firms to establish processing facilities in vietnam and export valueadded products in vietnam imported about million of sea products mainly salmon crab meat and caviar from norway france the us and other countries opportunities based on the technological inputs and available resources vietnams seafood products market can be divided into two categories semiprocessed products raw materials are simply processed and sent for further processing and packaged elsewhere and high valueadded products for canadian products this sector is confined to small markets for shellfish and smoked salmon mostly in the upscale hotel and restaurant sector although competition here is intense vietnam has ambitious plans to expand and upgrade its own production of seafood while some of these plans will likely be scaled back due to lack of available financing and other considerations it is still expected that the growth in seafood production and exports should healthily outpace the growth in population however with the continuing rise in income levels of many urban vietnamese canadian suppliers of higher quality and higher margin products should be ready to anticipate growth to critical mass levels for export in the next five to years the vietnamese ministry of fisheries is calling for additional investment through the overseas development agency oda and foreign direct investment fdi in the following areas • aquaculture with a concentration in shrimp breeding and inputs • upgrade of vessels for deepsea fishing larger engines chilling and storing equipment and • upgrade of processing facilities two main vietnamese export products catfish and shrimp have been subjected to antidumping and phytosanitary measures from major exporters such as the united states the european union and canada standards of local partners can be low and are often inefficiently managed

attention sea has some of the fastest growing economies in the world and a consumer population demanding better and safer food choices from international suppliers dont think of sea countries as economic disasters they have recovered well from the economic crisis per capita incomes are rising in sea due to economic growth and domestic consumption is increasingly important in thailand malaysia and indonesia vietnam has the highest gdp growth in the region and because of its low population growth per capita gdp will exceed that of the philippines in about years consumers who would be attracted to buy canadian products have more spending power to buy more prepared foods and dine out more often the predicted rise of currencies in the region against the us dollar over the next years will also contribute to rising per capita incomes in us terms as my predecessor wrote growth in the sea food manufacturing sector is creating solid opportunities for food ingredients while the increasing regional dominance of major supermarket chains such as cold storage giant carrefour tesco is creating opportunity for branded and private labels for serious canadian suppliers exports to the region in increased from a year low in to million almost million higher than in when canadian field crop supplies were low if you are a valueadded exporter you should know that value added product

contributed to indias sustained economic growth the emergence of new economy sectors such as information technology telecommunications media and entertainment have become vital to indias development overall india has created a modern economy with a largely selfsufficient agriculture sector diversified industry and a sophisticated financial and service sector estimates show that from to indias gdp

approximately of the workforce and accounting for of gdp the service sector which includes trade hotels banking transport and communications now accounts for of gdp and employs of the workforce industry makes up the remaining of workers and holds a share of national income in recent years indian foreign trade has greatly increased a serious financial crisis in led to major economic reforms which removed many government regulations on investment and trade furthermore india was an initial member of the world trade organization when it was established in subsequently quantitative restrictions on imports were gradually phased out and eliminated in during the period from to imports increased at an average rate of per year and exports rose by an annual average rate of the one area where growth has been sluggish is foreign direct investment fdi during the last few years fdi has been approximately of gdp it is also estimated that indias share of total fdi into developing countries such as china mexico brazil etc is only about to despite rapid economic growth there are distinct disparities in wealth between indias states more prosperous areas such as punjab haryana

bihar combine to account for of the population and of national income government role indias recent economic success has come largely through strict government guidance while this is mainly targeted at boosting exports particularly in agriculture and handicrafts the plan is also looking to make imports more affordable despite the fact that india is committed to encouraging broadbased growth and macroeconomic stability many of the governments current trade and investment policies protect sectors that are identified as being in a period of adjustment tariffs have been used to achieve this however the country is committed to progressively reducing import tariffs excise duties are also being simplified and the government is moving towards implementing a countrywide value added tax vat the declining role of the public sector as both a producer and consumer has been very important to indias recent growth however it is still a significant player in the economy in public sector expenditures were of gdp about of total government spending was put towards interest payments defence subsidies and general services such police and pensions india has the second largest population in the world with living in rural regions much of the countrys purchasing power however comes from those living in the urban areas it is estimated that million people are considered middle class as incomes rise this group has begun developing a taste for imported products however despite rapid economic development indias market for imported consumer goods still remains small relative to the number of people demographics total population billion population growth rate breakdown by age yrs yrs yrs and over life expectancy male female total as is the case for china and the us india is better described as a series of regional markets each with a strong cultural identity and marketing characteristics for instance every region or large city has its own distinct culinary tradition the common thread is that culture dining and food are strongly intertwined moreover an exceptionally large number of indians are vegetarian while most do not eat meat simply because they cannot afford a nonvegetarian diet cultural aspects must also be taken into consideration sikhs currently comprise of the indian population and are hindu both these religions consider cattle to be sacred and eating beef is taboo in addition are muslim this is the second largest muslim population after indonesia under this religion pork is not eaten according to traditional hinduism food is classified into three distinct categories sattavic which is freshly cooked pure vegetarian excluding some root crops it is traditionally eaten by yogis saints and upper caste brahmins and is said to calm the mind rajasic is nonvegetarian cuisine enriched with spices dry fruits butter and cream it is eaten by the royal class and is said to invigorate the mind and body tamasic includes preservedstored meat and leftovers it is eaten by the lower classes and is said to make the body and mind lethargic although this classification is a thing of the past many indians still believe food shapes the personality mood and mind many indians are quite willing to try new foods but usually return to traditional cuisine while western foods have a reasonably good chance of succeeding for casual dining integrating them into the main meal will be more difficult indians prefer fresh products and traditional spices and ingredients which has greatly slowed the penetration of north american style processed foods however there are signs of changing preferences since exotic vegetables such as black mushrooms lemon grass thai curry paste and a variety of sauces and dressings are increasingly in demand it should be pointed out that the many imported processed and packaged foods are tailored to suit the indian market for instance world renowned hamburger chains have altered their menus to remove beef and replace it with more acceptable meats other popular north american items have seen key ingredients switched with regional spices in an attempt to accelerate their acceptance packaging is also altered to meet the needs of the indian consumer most processed foods are sold in small containers due to customers limited purchasing power imported food items that can be spotted in large retail stores in cities include ketchup fruit juices chocolates biscuits chocolate syrup cake mixes canned soups pop corn potato chips canned fish ice cream and canned corn other processed foods in great demand include jams and jellies table butter and ghee melted butter various masalas and curry powders pickles wheat flour noodles snack foods mostly spicy indian types and health drinks demand for specialty items such as almonds and other nuts cakes pastries and sweetmeats indian sweets made primarily from milk products and fruits peak during the fall festive season especially at diwali the festival of lights for those with low incomes items such as refrigerators and microwaves are considered luxury goods that are available only to the wealthy as a result indians shop on a daily basis at small neighbourhood specialty shops or roadside vendors ie fruits and vegetables in one shop dairy products in another groceries in a third and meat and fish in yet another only in the past few years have indians been exposed to selfservice supermarkets availability of many items particularly fruits and vegetables is very seasonal and people are accustomed to adjusting their diet accordingly women do most of the shopping and make most of the food purchasing decisions however households able to afford western imports usually have servants who buy clean and prepare the foods inadequate provision of high quality and reasonably priced infrastructure services is a major barrier to continued growth of the economy inefficiencies and shortfalls in capacity are reflected in congested roads and ports frequent power outages and drinking water shortages the primary forms of travel in india are road rail and boat india has the third largest road network in the world however only half of its million kilometers are paved highways make up of the overall network but account for of the total traffic according to the indian government roads carry of passenger traffic and of the freight traffic as a result india has a large scale problem with congestion on its roads in transportation of goods the country also suffers from a lack of refrigerated vehicles indias rail system is a vital artery throughout the country roughly of the network is electrified in the fiscal year rail was responsible for moving an estimated million tonnes of freight and approximately billion passengers with its extensive coastline indias exports and imports have come to rely on a system of ports in fiscal about of total port traffic was in the form of dry and liquid bulk with the remaining consisting of general cargo and containers in total million tonnes of cargo passed through indias ports chennai cochin ennore jawaharlal nehru kandla kolkata marmagao mumbai new mangalore paradip tuticorin and visakhapatnam distribution and sales channels importers are key players in the distribution system in india besides importing directly and distributing products well established importers and distributors are responsible for ensuring that customs quarantine and import procedures run smoothly when selling goods india has both organized and unorganized sales channels the unorganized sector is very prevalent and consists of local shops and familyrun street corner stalls that sell everything from vegetables to shoes retailing is very traditional and bargainingnegotiation are common ways of shopping the organized retail sector is still quite small chain stores only represent about of the overall retail market recently foreign retailers have begun moving into the country while department stores supermarkets and shopping malls are being developed however the current landscape of the retail sector remains extremely fragmented indias urban population centers are widely dispersed and nationwide distribution is very difficult it is important to keep in mind that due to its size and complications from inadequate infrastructure it is often necessary to use a number of distributors located in different regions in order to implement a national distribution strategy for rural india in particular there are large obstacles in distribution rural regions consist of an intricate network of villages which are often difficult to access because of poor road conditions indias total trade has increased significantly in recent years reaching us billion in imports were us billion and exports were valued at us billion indias most valuable exports include diamonds oil not crude and textile goods the countrys largest export partners are the united states the united arab emirates china singapore and the uk the most

economic cooperation group bimstec the indian government has preferential andor free trade treaties with nepal and srilanka afghanistan maldives bhutan bangladesh and thailand as well additionally singapore and india have recently entered into a free trade agreement which was signed on june currently india is involved in talks with china brazil and south africa for the purpose of establishing bilateral agreements for promoting trade and investment import duties traditionally india has maintained high tariffs and other import restrictions on food items however some commodities such as pulses are more easily imported since tariffs are relatively lower and regulations are less stringent these are the basic customs duty the surcharge the additional duty of customs and the special additional duty the basic customs duty can be a percentage rate ad valorem rate applied to the value of the goods valued at cost insurance and freight cif or a specific rate based on unit of measurement this duty is commodity specific so different rates of duty apply for different products for agriculture and food products the basic customs duty can be as high as the surcharge is levied at a rate of of the basic customs duty the additional duty of customs or countervailing duty is equal to the excise duty applied on like goods producedmanufactured domestically in india these excise duties can be as high as depending on the product furthermore this duty is applied on the total value of the goods calculated as the value at cif plus the basic customs duty lastly the special additional duty is a rate that differs by product and is levied on the total value of goods computed as the value at cif along with the basic customs duty and the additional duty of customs aside from the four duties described previously additional levies such as antidumping duties safeguard duties etc may also be applied however under certain conditions and depending on the type of goods imported exemptions may be available relative to the rest of the world india is a very significant player in the agriculture sector according to statistics provided by the indian governments department of agriculture and cooperation the country ranks second in the world after the us in terms of arable land it also has more irrigated area than any other country india is largely selfsufficient in the production of food and is among the top international producers of a vast array of agricultural commodities it is the worlds number one producer of pulses tea jute and milk in addition it has the largest cattle and buffalo herd overall india ranks third in the world in cereal grain production ranked second in the world in wheat and rice production has the worlds largest livestock population and is among the top producers of various fruits vegetables and oilseeds among the countrys major products sold abroad are rice soybean meal cashews wheat and tea imports of agriculture and food products into india in grew by reaching us billion approximately of these imports were edible oils most notably palm and soybean oil overall india experienced a trade surplus in agriculture and food products in of about us billion a increase from despite the fact that india is among the worlds largest producers of oilseeds edible vegetable oils dominate all imports demand for edible vegetable oils has risen rapidly as incomes increase in contrast oilseed production has stagnated due to an inability to increase yields and high tariffs have hindered imports this situation has left indias crushing and oil refining industry with large amounts of idle capacity utilization rate is estimated at only and the country with a burgeoning supply deficit in edible oils which is balanced off with imports currently india is the largest importer of edible oils in the world a similar situation exists with pulses despite indias status as the worlds largest producer india is still a net importer this is because pulses are an important source of protein and local production has failed to keep pace with population growth and rising demand from increasing incomes an additional note of interest is that although much of india sees cattle as sacred animals cattle slaughter occurs in the states of kerala and west bengal slaughter is usually restricted to older cattle and is illegal in all other states this practice is extremely controversial and there have been government proposals to completely ban it currently the political debate over this matter continues and it seems that a decision will not be made in the near future turning to other aspects of the supply chain traditionally there has not been much valueadded production in india however demand for processed food is increasing with rising incomes and changing tastes from to retail sales volume of dried processed food eg rice dried pasta noodles etc grew by of these sales branded rice accounted for approximately in markets for highvalue dairy products such as skimmed milk powder whole milk powder butter oil whey powder lactose and energy and health products such as vitaminenriched yogurts are also growing despite indias economic success over the last few years agricultural trade between india and canada has experienced only moderate growth for the to period canadian exports have fluctuated reaching a peak in of us million however there was a decrease from that point with exports reaching us million in overall the trend in exports from to has been increasing with an average annual growth rate of roughly over the same period canadas imports from india decreased to a low of us million in and subsequently increased reaching us million in the most significant agricultural exports to india are dried peas chickpeas lentils and mustard seed these four commodities make up approximately of the total the largest agricultural imports from india into canada are rice cashews raw shelled peanuts and sesame seeds import competitors and opportunities as identified previously canadas agricultural exports to india consist almost entirely of pulses overall canada is a major supplier of these products to india but there are many competitors for dried peas canada is the top supplier but australia and france are major exporters as well the largest suppliers for chickpeas are iran turkey and australia aside from canada nepal and china play a major role in indias lentil imports and there is also competition from belgium and germany in the mustard seed market in addition to the growing pulse markets there maybe potential in oilseeds currently imports of oilseeds into india face high tariffs however the strong demand for edible oils and idle oil production capacity in the country has led to indias minister of agriculture to speak publicly about importing oilseeds in the future canadas participation in indias agriculture and agrifood sector is not limited to livestock and crops export opportunities also exist in a range of related agribusiness activities which include • agribusiness covering agriculture horticulture fisheries dairy poultry post harvest technology cold storage infrastructure bulk storage handling and transportation of grain and other produce • biotechnology in agriculture horticulture processing research and development market constraints some of the general market constraints that canadian exporters encounter when entering india are distance poor infrastructure and a large vegetarian population more specifically some of the challenges that need to be overcome are • competition from suppliers with more advantageous geographic proximity such as australia • diverse agroindustrial base offering many products at very competitive prices • preference for fresh products and traditional foods • difficulties in accessing the vast untapped rural markets • inadequate infrastructure eg ports roads electricity cold storage • stringent food regulations and high tariffs

email apurvamehtadfaitmaecigcca market informationasia pacific the retail food market in thekansai region of japan issue chain store operators in japan are currently facing huge changes in their business environment foreign supermarket giants such as carrefour costco walmart and tesco have entered the japanese market and food distribution channels are changing rapidly some regional chain stores are going to extraordinary lengths to differentiate themselves from the competition in particular they are looking to directly source imported processed foods description today canada is the fourth largest exporter of food products to the kansai region with an import market share of percent canadas share in total japanese food imports was in canadian food exports to japan have met with varying degrees of success for example canadas processed wheat products hold the third position in japans processed wheat products market its alcoholic beverages hold eighth position overall and coffee and tea products hold a distant th position in the late s there was a boom of direct food importation by japanese supermarket chain operators however supermarkets faced problems such as inventory control when importing food directly and consequently many of them withdrew from direct import operations recently many retail chain stores in japan have either begun practicing or are considering practicing direct importing from foreign food producers due to a number of contributing factors these include the market entry of foreign chain store operators changes to distribution channels an increase in consumer knowledge of imported foods a desire to raise the profile of their specialty chains in comparison with the competition and the substantial buying power of japanese consumers market entry by foreign operators recent market infiltration by foreign companies has facilitated common customer access to imported processed foods in the french supermarket carrefour opened its first japan store in a suburb city of metropolitan tokyo costco wholesale club opened its second japan store that same year right next door to this carrefour carrefour currently has seven stores in japan four of which are in the kansai region and costco has four stores one of which is also located in the kansai region in july it was reported that the united kingdom supermarket giant tesco plc had launched a tender offer to purchase shares of c twonetwork co furthermore the worlds largest retail store chain us based walmart has entered the japanese market by becoming a major share holder of seiyu co ltd japans third largest supermarket chain with seiyu stores in the kansai and by introducing walmarts world famous supply system to japan some of the existing seiyu stores have already shifted to walmarts operating procedures with the rest to follow because of this recent entry by foreign competitors japanese retailers need to become more competitive and attractive to general consumers large japanese chain operators such as aeon jusco and ito yokado compete directly with these foreign giants aeon asias second largest retailing group is aggressively acquiring regional supermarkets to form a larger supermarket group it bailed out mycal for example which went into receivership in september with an outstanding debt of billion mycals failure was the largest ever corporate bond default in japan on october mycal became a fullfledged subsidiary of aeon as a result aeon became the largest retail chain operator in japan with stores in the kansai region alone regional chain store operators want to and must differentiate themselves from these giant retailers some are focusing on fresh food sales such as meat seafood and vegetables to establish close ties with the local community others are trying to increase the stature of their store brand by carrying a wide variety of imported processed food b in many cases through direct import operations it is these companies that provide an excellent opportunity for canadian suppliers food wholesalers still play an important role in the japanese food distribution channel although a few big japanese supermarket chains such as aeon jusco are trying to introduce direct buying operations with domestic food manufacturers most japanese retail food chain store operators still rely on the information and logistical network of wholesalers for product sourcing this might be the most significant difference in the food distribution channel between japan and north america including canada historically speaking the japanese food wholesale sector is divided by product category most of the large nationwide food wholesalers in japan started as processed food wholesalers however to serve their customers more efficiently wholesalers are in the process of expanding through mergers acquisitions and strategic alliances to include items other than the usual processed foods such as liquor and frozen and chilled foods on the other hand smaller wholesalers are not able to survive alone due to changes in the business environment such as the deregulation of liquor sales in the seventh largest wholesaler sanyu co ltd and the ninth largest wholesaler koami co ltd merged into sanyukoami co ltd to become the fifth largest food wholesaler in japan as of april sanyukoami co in march kokubu corporation japans largest food wholesaler gained percent of tokyos hiroya co ltd shares hiroya is a well established liquor wholesaler dating back more than years a few months later in september saihara co ltd one of the leading food wholesalers in osaka for the last years was taken over by japans second largest wholesaler ryoshoku co ltd as a result saihara became a complete subsidiary of ryoshoku following these trends in the japanese wholesaling industry large wholesalers are growing in size and the total number of wholesalers is shrinking rapidly according to the most radical forecasts from industry insiders only seven nationwide wholesalers in japan will survive the decade as the number of wholesalers shrinks there will be fewer sources of product purchasing for japanese retailers in a situation in which more than retail chain operators rely on less than wholesalers for product sourcing it will be extremely difficult for stores to differentiate themselves by their products alone thus importing directly from foreign food manufacturers and suppliers is looking more and more attractive to regional chains an increase in consumer knowledge in todays internet age general consumers particularly ainnovative consumers have an excellent tool with which to look for nutritional diet and food information in addition japanese consumers have a deep knowledge of imported food products they not only gain information through the internet but also are frequent overseas travelers these types of consumers often ask for their favourite imported products at regional retail stores raise the profile of stores generally speaking there is a wide variety of imported processed foods on store shelves in highend japanese supermarkets or department stores some famous food brands such as walkers shortbread enjoy high brand recognition even among general consumers for store operators that decide to compete with national chain stores carrying a wide variety of quality imported processed foods is a must it is possible to source these products from existing importers or wholesalers in japan but direct importing from foreign suppliers helps chains to carry and market their own uniquely chosen products buying power of japanese consumers japanese consumers equate price with quality and are often sceptical of cheap largevolume products at the same time people are cutting back on spending and are becoming increasingly pricesensitive discount stores and onecoin shops yen shops are gaining in popularity japanese consumers are pricesensitive when buying daily commodities yet tend to spend more freely on premium or brandname products quality not quantity as many foreign firms such as walmart quickly discovered is one extremely critical aspect of japanese consumerism and marketing quality applies equally and strictly to food and beverage products if a product has excellent quality is nicely packaged and of course tastes good people are not reluctant to pay a premium in fy the average japanese household spent nearly on food products almost half of this amount was spent on processed food products alone interestingly was spent on sweets such as cakes and candies the average household also spent around eating out in or approximately month nonalcoholic beverage products and alcoholic drink expenditures accounted for around year respectively clearly japanese consumers are willing to commit a large portion of their income towards quality food and beverage products impact on canadian companies despite some recent moves towards simplification the japanese food distribution system remains complex and multilayered canadian food exporters who have good products for the japanese retail market will find market entry easier through retail chain stores that are importing directly all chain stores that import directly without exception have concerns regarding the volume of purchasing lots when placing an order with foreign exporters for example sometimes the order volume does not meet the minimum order of the exporters chain store operators have indicated that this is particularly the case when dealing with exporters in the united states rather than europe or asia the minimum order set by us exporters is usually too large for mediumsized retail store chains which prefer small lot orders repeated on a regular basis in order to reduce the concern of dead stock competitive canadian exporters who are flexible in this respect will find great opportunity in japans processed food retail market contacts canadian consulate general in osaka nishi

larger than india’s such developments will have a dramatic affect on consumers’ purchasing power and taste for more sophisticated western products and services in certain highgrowth cities this change could further boost chinese consumption of canadian agrifood products as western foods particularly health natural organic and convenience foods have become popular staples in many urban chinese diets attractive geographic markets the following cities are expected high growth areas that will hold great opportunity for canadian exporters looking to enter the chinese market northeast region • quingdao shandong province quingdao home to million is regarded as one of china’s most prosperous cities and ranked first in the country for quality of life in the city’s retail food sector has grown

prepared foods and food service stations o dalianbased retail food chain dashang reported the second highest sales volume in all of china in outpacing large foreignowned multinationals such as carrefour and walmart dalian is recognized for high consumer spending southwest interior region • chengdu sichaun province chengdu is regarded as one of the most affluent cities in the western region of china home to more than million chinese and a gdp of us billion chengdu is often referred to as china’s breadbasket due to its significant agricultural output chengdu acts as the main transportation centre for the region due to its prime location between west and southeast china as well as its new highways and airport china’s famous sichaun cuisine originates from the city and has contributed to making food an important part of local culture however imported foods have not penetrated the market to the same degree as in other cities and many distributors are unaware of foreign products o due to chengdu’s deep location in the interior of china exporting goods to the region can be challenging as distribution networks remain limited andor underdeveloped between the city and other provinces consumer incomes many wealthy middle and upperclass consumers are found in welldeveloped or rapidly developing cities and share a number of similar characteristics although china’s average gross income per capita in was highincome earners in large urban centres like beijing shanghai and guangzhou can make as much as per month and see more than three times the annual average gross per capita income in comparison welloff residents of emerging cities such as chengdu are likely to earn an average monthly income of to disposable income accounts for approximately of gross profit and is usually allocated toward the purchase of houses cars digital products and tailored personal services among members of the proposed urban target market expenditure on soft products such as financial services concerts sports centres and travel is also on the rise this trend is likely to continue as disposable income is expected to reach more than of gross income by lucrative consumer segments with the rising affluence of chinese and a burgeoning middleclass five key consumer segments stand out as potentially lucrative markets for canadian agrifood exporters to target • middleaged middleclass adults middleaged consumers ie between the ages of and comprise over of the chinese population a large part of the middleclass and most of the public’s elite among this consumer segment are a number of professionals including engineers scholars doctors scientists and business people many of who are becoming increasingly successful at younger ages this segment is currently increasing demand for sophisticated western products and services which constitute a large part of their expenditure presenting considerable opportunities for canadian exports foreigneducated chinese bring home knowledge and taste for international goods and are becoming a very influential subgroup however price sensitivity remains a key issue that exporters need to consider when positioning products for this consumer segment therefore have to carefully position their products to specific teenage segments of the chinese market • empty nesters china’s empty nester segment accounted for nearly of households in and is expected to increase to of the population by an approximate million families a large portion of empty nesters are also dual income families and are usually found amongst high income and welleducated consumer groups this segment can afford to spend a lot on luxury products travel sports and dining out healthy food products readymade meals and portable foods are likely to be popular within this group highincome families the number of highincome families in china is rapidly increasing such consumers hold highincome jobs and prefer modern living communities therefore they are likely to be concentrated in highly urbanized regions and wealthy cities highincome families lead expensive lifestyles and spend a lot of their incomes on sports and travel premium canadian agrifood products as well as natural organic and healthy convenience foods could show considerable success within this market segment such chinese are typically well educated own a home and car and spend a large part of their disposable income on luxury products natural organic and premium canadian agrifood products will probably show the most success amongst this consumer group with increased awareness about the benefits of nutritious eating the popularity of organic and health foods is rising in china the chinese population is increasingly working longer hours leading busier lifestyles and earning larger disposable incomes although increases in wealth and income are highly limited to southern and eastern coastal urban areas and surrounding regions as a result consumer demand for packaged processed readytoeat and takeaway foods is also greatly increasing particularly demand for fast noodles and rice which is very common in urban areas however processed foods have not yet become widely popular among chinese due to food safety problems that have plagued the industry in the past new food processing safety regulations are expected to improve the sector’s performance in the future as is the case in many countries traditional eating habits are modified as cultural and social changes surface with china having seen an influx of westernstyle fast food chains and products bolstered by western lifestyles shown through media consumers have trended toward purchasing more meals from such outlets and moving away from eating traditional chinese dishes however further distribution of health information through media and educational programs should help increase awareness of healthy eating and counteract this negative trend in turn demand for healthy and organic foods may rise presenting more opportunities for canadian agrifood exporters consumer expenditure totalled billion in and is expected to rise approximately to reach trillion by recent increases in consumer disposable income fuelled by rapid economic growth have allowed chinese to purchase food that they previously could not afford meat consumption particularly beef mutton pork and chicken has risen in recent years as well as that of natural and organic foods • china consumes of the world’s pork of rice of ice cream of poultry and of beef as one of the largest consumer markets in the world china annually consumes million tons of meat million tons of vegetables and over million tons of fruit • approximately of overall household expenditure is allocated to the purchase of food and nonalcoholic beverages while that of urban consumers is closer to this number has been decreasing over the past several years although consumers are on average spending more on such goods in terms of dollar value a trend which illustrates the rise in the chinese standard of living • of total food expenditure in urban areas goes toward food for consumption outside of the home • in consumers spent billion on food and nonalcoholic beverages this value is expected to increase by to reach billion by • as chinese increasingly lead busier lifestyles the demand for safe processed foods and convenience products as well as healthy and organic foods is rising fast growing commodities include healthy snack foods eg nuts dried fruit fresh fruit eg apples cherries oranges pears seafood poultry and red meat frozen vegetables especially sweet corn and potato products dairy products especially ice cream mexican food functional readytocook and – eat foods and baby food and instant formula • processed foods are more popular in urban areas as poor logistics and infrastructure make it difficult for exporters and distributors to reach consumers in rural areas rural consumers therefore prefer fresh foods due to price and availability • due to the vast size of china’s emerging middle class and the expenditure and attention it will command over the next decade canadian agrifood exporters may want to include this target market in their marketentry strategy andor focus their entire plan on this consumer segment staples • rice meat fish and vegetables are staples of the chinese diet consumers living in northern regions of china typically consume more flourbased products than their counterparts in southern areas of the country potatoes and sweet potatoes are also commonly found in chinese meals with annual consumption averaging lb and lb per capita respectively with a push for healthier foods chinese consumption of vegetables has greatly increased in recent years between and per capita consumption of vegetables rose by almost to reach lb per capita green vegetables remain the most consumed fresh foods in china fruit consumption in general especially citrus fruit due to its vitamin c properties increased about between and as it is considered a healthy way to manage weight gain consumer brandrecognition and demand for variety and quality is increasing however product price still remains a major factor in influencing purchasing decisions this may therefore have some impact on the sale of imported premium goods organic products and highquality fresh foods consumption of soft drinks increased by between and even more impressive was readytodrink rtd tea which more than doubled with a increase over the fiveyear period to l per capita consumption growth in asian specialty drinks followed at and l per capita fruit and vegetable juice at and l per capita and bottled water with a increase and l per capita consumption this trend is directly influenced by a desire for healthier eating among chinese consumers alcoholic beverage consumption has risen in recent years mainly due to increases in consumer disposable incomes and is mostly enjoyed during meals among wealthy chinese beer white spirits and wine are the most frequently consumed alcoholic beverages however chinese spirits are generally preferred over imported brands due to differences in price and taste key opportunities within china’s food and beverage market include convenience and processed food products health foods and snacks organic foods and fish and seafood the organic food market remains quite small in china in comparison to those of other nations however while organic foods only comprise of the total food sector given the size of the market this value remains considerable • retail food sales reached billion in an approximate increase over the total of million • the chinese middle class is quickly growing as evidenced by the development of large multiproduct stores and shopping centres that service large middle class concentrations within the country metro rt mart trustmart parkson’s crcvangyard emart lotus eleven family mart cstore and lawson’s however imports only make up of inventory in such outlets due to the small presence of imported foods in the chinese marketplace instore demonstrations samples and promotions are recommended to stimulate trial and repeat purchases many chinese are still very price sensitive and highly influenced by bargains and salespersons’ suggestions often resulting in last minute changes to their purchases china’s principal agrifood import sources the united states australia brazil argentina and malaysia represent canada’s top competition in the chinese export market furthermore china’s cepa with hong kong and macao also influences how numerous exports enter the country as this relationship facilitates product admission via guangdong province much easier than in the past domestic food producers and processors also present considerable competition for canadian agrifood exporters as almost all chinese supermarket and hypermarket chains only contain homegrown goods foreignowned retail food chains may present the best market entry distribution and product placement opportunities for canadian exports however such goods currently only represent of total food

market advice and best position products to meet local tastes laws and pricing china is member of the un apec and wto and implements international accords and policies from these bodies the majority of china’s requirements governing imports are coordinated with wto regulations while others are specific to the country canadian exporters should confirm that their chinese importer has the

available for public viewing wool tobacco and tobacco products cotton grains sugar vegetable oil and carbonated and alcoholic beverages are subject to import quotas and require an import licence china customs typically levies a value added tax vat on imported goods however tariffs vary depending on the category certain imports belong to although many tariffs were lowered with wto accession further reductions are expected until the target for is reached import licensing and quotas are also expected to be eliminated in phases canadian exporters should ask their chinese importers to disclose all

of consumer data valuable when estimating export potential and niche markets key points on chinese consumers growing tastes for international goods and services of annual living expenditure allocated to food purchases strong variations between urban and rural consumption patterns chinese view canadian products as high quality strong variations in younger generation consumption compared to older generation consumption chinese consumers appreciate and are willing to pay for quality but react positively to a good bargain which caters to their innate desire to save the country’s population control program or one child rule began in the late s and has contributed to the trend in higher disposable incomes purchasing power parity has grown from us in to us in and us in major citiesregions

spicy and the south preferring delicate tastes consumer details strong variations in younger generation consumption compared to older generation consumption senior age groups consume more rice fruits and vegetables traditional while younger generations branch out consuming products such as processed foods snacks meats and alcoholic beverages nontraditional urbanized population consume more meat processed food restaurant meals and less grains rural households grow most of their own food and have less access to markets stores processed food and refrigeration grain is still a major component of the rural diet consumer traits imported products are generally accepted and viewed as high quality safer worthy of their higher price tag and in some cases stylish status symbols consumers are attracted to established brand names as they are seen as a guarantee of authentic and quality goods chinese consumers have strong loyalty to high quality brands and frequently recommend those products and services to others word of mouth communication is key to product success in china although there is little brand loyalty to foreign products and fads come and go quickly local manufacturers are always able to quickly replicate international products and produce them for less therefore there is great potential for imported products but domestic competition to follow is a strong threat an increase in consumption is determined by income levels as well as consumer confidence in recent overall economic situation chinese consumers are recognized for their desire to save money but they are willing to pay for quality and other positive factors in a product the meets their needs younger consumers are now entering into their prime earning years and have a greater discretionary income the urban segment of the younger generation are familiarizing themselves with foreign lifestyles and global media consumers prefer smaller packaging even though price may be higher chinese consumers appreciate attractive packaging in terms of size color and design chinese consumers continue to prove their willingness and openmindedness to new western tastes and products traditionally food products were purchased daily form local wet markets and dry goods from local state run stores recently westernstyle retail stores have slowly replaced this traditional retail structure retail outlets have evolved to house flashy displays and a vast range of goods in one place supermarket chains are now in almost every chinese city while hypermarkets reside in most large cities convenience store chains have also rapidly blanketed the country mostly in east china shanghai alone has over convenience stores distribution systems vary dramatically by region and market eastern coastal regions including shanghai and beijing represent the strongest consumer markets for imported goods distribution options for canadian exporters include direct sales to retail outlets existing distribution networks and warehousing agents and sales reps or establishing independent distribution networks best option for small exporters is the use of a sales agent due to market and retail knowledge specific to the region reaching the consumer marketing practices it is often recommended that before jumping into the chinese market exporters should invest in targeted market research and taste testing in a country as large and diverse in tastes as china it is critical to identify a specific target group of consumers and confirm if your product appeals to this group this practice is not meant to limit market potential but rather decipher whether it exists and is possible to build on trends specific to canadian food exports china is canada’s fourth largest export destination and ninth largest source of imports opportunity for canadian agrifood exports exist china is an ideal market for canada to capitalize on trends towards processed food products specifically in fish seafood and meats because of canada’s reputation for high quality products trends in the marketplace also reveal opportunity in the dairy products category wine beverages confectionary and nutraceuticals an increase in retail

osakatdinternationalgcca internet wwwinfoexportgcca market overview japan with a population of almost million people is the worlds largest net importer of food products the kansai is home to million people and accounts for a regional gdp larger than the countries of canada or australia the kansai region of japan also plays a central role in japanese culinary culture with its residents enjoying a reputation for the highest taste and food quality in japan osaka has grown as a commercial and distribution centre for food commodities total food imports for the kansai region in were billion down just slightly from japanese familystyle restaurant chains are important targets for canadian food exporters looking to promote their products to the japanese food service industry although their demand for price quality and delivery is high japanese familystyle restaurant management practices are often more forward thinking than those of traditional japanese restaurant businesses as a result they are more open to considering imported products with some chain owners creating their own inhouse import operations this report focuses on japanese familystyle restaurant chain operators particularly those operators based in the kansai region of japan the familystyle restaurant business in japan started in when skylark co ltd opened its first restaurant in kunitachi city in tokyo the preponderance of such restaurants grew in accordance with the rapid growth of the japanese economy particularly in the s and s skylark co ltd is now the top familystyle restaurant chain operator in terms of annual sales see table current top familystyle restaurant chain operators in japan ranking by sales corporate name company headquarters annual sales millions number of outlets skylark co ltd japan company hand book spring january it is estimated that the size of the japan food service market in including hotel catering and all diningout businesses such as restaurants fast food counters and cafeterias was around billion the top familystyle restaurants above account for about of this industry japanese familystyle restaurant chains offer a wide variety of menu items to their customers at a reasonable cost including dishes from japan italy china and korea to lower operation costs these chains purchase ingredients in large volume and process them in central kitchens most of the food preparation occurs in these central kitchens and the kitchens of individual restaurants are responsible for only the final stage of warming up frying or sautéing the semiprocessed products for the consumer familystyle restaurant chains have modern management systems and tend to be more businessoriented than traditional food service industry players they are very openminded to foreign food suppliers that can provide products which meet their requirements some chain operators also import food products directly from foreign suppliers in order to reduce the costs of the multilayered food distribution system in japan opportunities canadian companies should target different restaurant chains depending on the product they are trying to sell currently there are strong differences in company strategy among familystyle restaurants particularly in regards to pricing family restaurant chains such as saizeria operated by saizeria co ltd or gusto operated by skylark co ltd offer less expensive menu items but variety and service are limited in all cases restaurant operators are seeking to distinguish their chain based on value variety andor quality as mentioned some familystyle restaurant chains have established their own direct import operations with foreign suppliers targeting these companies allows canadian exporters to enter the market without getting involved in japans complicated food distribution system however suppliers should be aware that restaurant chains demand a high volume of product of consistent quality with as little variation in price as possible meeting these requirements is challenging but companies able to comply with such guidelines will increase their chances of success in the japanese familystyle restaurant market the kansai region is the home of japanese culinary culture historically speaking the city of kyoto was the capital of japan for more than years most traditional japanese cuisine was developed in kyoto and passed on to other regions of japan the city of osaka was developed as a commercial and distribution centre for food commodities to support the culinary culture in kyoto even now people in the kansai region particularly those in osaka are noted for their love of food and their propensity to spend on gourmet and exotic foods presently there are more than restaurants in the kansai region roughly of all of japans restaurants with over in osaka city alone to survive fierce competition familystyle restaurant chains in the kansai must continually improve their operations and services there are three see below wellknown familystyle restaurant chains operating out of the kansai region with all three focussing on the development of japanese food menu items to avoid any misunderstanding it must be noted that this is not the highlypriced formal japanese food japanese haute cuisine which traditionally consists of several courses of fancylooking food instead kansaibased familystyle restaurants promote modern japanese cuisine which has developed since japan was introduced to western culture in the th century examples of this type of cuisine include deepfried pork tonkatsu hamburger patties without the bun and grilled meat or fish with a soybased sauce a wide variety of meat fish and western vegetables are used in this type of cuisine thereby providing opportunity to foreign food suppliers including those from canada generally speaking these familystyle restaurant chain operators are very open to foreign products as long as the products meet their standards in terms of quality safety and cost in addition it must be noted that one company in osaka imports directly from foreign food suppliers this gives canadian companies a potentially easier entry into the kansai region market for product sourcing all familystyle restaurant chains feel the need to diversify their supply sources due to the recent incidents of bse the breakout of avian flu and problems resulting from agricultural chemical residue in chinese vegetables key participants the kansai region imported million worth of canadian food in giving canada th spot or of kansais imported agrifood market share after that of the united states china and australia despite this respectable showing canadian market share has decreased compared to its foreign competitors this is in part due to market restrictions based on food safety issues but perhaps can also be attributed to canadian exporters lack of activity or focus in the regional markets in japan private and publicsector customers the average spending per guest at familystyle restaurants is estimated to be about customers spend on average per person at saizaria or gusto but more than at sato or kagonoya just as restaurant chains seek to distinguish themselves based on value versus quality and variety consumers choose different familystyle restaurant chains depending on the dining situation it is important to note these differences and tailor canadian exporting strategies to the respective chains it may also be of interest for canadian exporters in developing a market strategy to understand how often customers dine at familystyle restaurants and how often familystyle restaurants are frequented in the current japanese economy see graph japan consumer market research institute more than of japanese dine at familystyle restaurants more than once a month interestingly this same survey revealed that single females such as students or office workers are the most frequent users of familystyle restaurants almost half of single young females replied that they frequent familystyle restaurants more than twice a month consumers who dine more than once a month at familystyle restaurants indicated that they use familystyle restaurants for weekend or holiday lunches weekend or holiday dinners and weekday lunches below are brief profiles of three wellknown kansaibased familystyle restaurant chain operators sato is the thlargest familystyle restaurant chain operator in japan with outlets as of june satos operation is centred in the kansai region but is expanding to other parts of japan such as nagoya and tokyo this chain has focussed on a modern japanesestyle menu since its inception and is considered to be a rather highend familystyle restaurant the average bill per person is currently but this figure is increasing the most unique aspect of this company is that they have their own direct import operations particularly for items such as seafood and meat they currently import pork from canada for a deepfried pork dish friendly corporation ranked th or th in japan in terms of sales as of june friendly operates restaurants in the kansai region they began their business as a western familystyle restaurant operator under the restaurant name of friendly however due to the declining popularity of westernstyle family dining friendly has opened restaurants under the name bonds which focuses on japanese cuisine in a familystyle restaurant setting currently half of friendlys restaurants now operate under the bonds name and this percentage is expected to continue growing the average bill per customer at friendly is but for bonds kinrei corporation kinrei started as a frozen food manufacturer and entered the familystyle restaurant business in early since then they have developed into a chain of restaurants as of june their restaurant brand kagonoya is considered to be the most highend familystyle restaurant in the kansai region they serve exclusively japanesestyle dishes and the average bill per customer is more than until the outbreak of bse in the united states kagonoya promoted a beef shabushabu menu item thinly sliced meat boiled in hot water at the customers table they have since shifted to pork shabushabu and are currently using canadian pork for this menu item key contacts canadian consulate general in osaka nishi shinsaibashichuoku osaka japantoshihisa seki trade commissionertel fax email

showed the highest growth among hw oils and fats organic oils and fats are only available in olive oil and vegetable seed oil within these areas organic products have recently grown robustly this healthy performance stems from the countrys burgeoning wellbeing boom industry efforts to feature additional health benefits for inherently healthy product groups have also contributed to the pattern for example the latest organic launches in olive oil have attracted highly healthconscious consumers through online or offline organic shopping stores or the food corners of prestigious department stores while smallscale players largely shape the demand sales are showing an impressive pace of growth the major reason for the lack of product availability in other areas such as margarine butter and spreadable oils fats is fact that these product groups are more or less unhealthy due to their levels of fat this implies that inherently unhealthy food items are unfavorably poised to secure any significant hw demand the key organic olive oil brand is organic lio extra virgin olive oil produced by lio in turkey as a promotional tool distributors mainly emphasize the name power of the brand and the company as one of the worlds best organic olive oil producers in contrast to the domination of organic olive oil by an imported label organic vegetable seed oil is dominated by smallscale domestic players when it comes to distribution the channels available for such products are currently limited as only online organic stores and limited offline food stores offer them naturally healthy oils and fats dominate in hw oils and fats sales of ‘naturally healthy olive oil account for over of total oils and fats sales olive oil sales grew strongly from onwards increasing health concerns held by south korean consumers coupled with the wellbeing boom underpinned the growth in the meantime the growth seen in was unprecedented with total retail consumption volume of olive oil jumping a marked from tonnes in to tonnes in this phenomenon was driven by an influx of domestic oils and fats players into olive oil with their own local labels using imported materials baeksul extra virgin olive oil by cj corp was the only domestic brand in however domestic oils and fats players aggressively entered the field attempting to benefit from this increasingly lucrative area new domestic brands included haepyo compressed olive oil by shindongbang co ltd ottogi fresco extra virgin olive oil and ottogi fresco pure olive oil by ottogi co ltd and chungjungwon chambitgoun olive oil by daesang group the core growth engines look set to be organic olive oil and organic vegetable seed oil industry players may move into featuring additional health benefits to existing formats in order to push up sales consumers are also increasingly exposed to organic oils and fats despite their high price levels products are still attractive due to their prestigious images and high quality ingredients compounded by the countrys emerging organic boom there is ample growth potential in the near future based on the currently small demand base nevertheless a narrow base of highend consumers will continue to form the majority of demand in olive oil foreign organic labels imported from overseas are likely to lead the sales for the time being as domestic production of olive is not possible in the local climate future outlook organic oils and fats to show healthiest growth the future of hw oils and fats looks bright at the moment the key growth factor is likely to be increasing health concerns held by south koreans compounded by the countrys burgeoning wellbeing boom the highest growth looks set to stem from organic olive oil and organic vegetable seed oil this is partly from their rather embryonic sales bases at the moment coupled with the countrys emerging organic boom as consumers and industry players are both increasingly moving towards the additional health benefits of the already healthy oils and fats products substantial growth is likely in the near future over the forecast period organic oils and fats products are predicted to double their presence overall in constant value terms taking a share of in oils and fats are an essential cooking item as the consumption of the products is more or less necessary consumers are likely to seek health benefits from the given products rather than seeking out alternatives in other product areas because of this manufacturers will increasingly add health benefits to existing products as well as creating new product ranges with a health orientation olive oil ready for hw diversification with greater product availability coupled with enlarged distribution channels organic olive oil looks set to continue its robust growth momentum most local consumers are well aware of the health benefits of olive oil in the past higher pricing over vegetable seed oil discouraged its consumption while recently introduced domestic brands by leading local producers still carry high pricing similar to imported brands increasing product availability suggests the possibility that future pricing will be reduced to a certain extent over the forecast period if this happens the consumer base is expected to widen leading to increasing local demand for organic olive oil which will contribute to the overall growth of olive oil

highprofile food safety issues such as bse and avian influenza on general consumer food purchasing and consumption trends in korea description the canadian embassy in korea recently commissioned a consumer survey to learn more about korean habits and attitudes toward the foods they buy and eat the purpose of this survey was to assist canadian companies in making marketing decisions based on current food purchasing trends in korea the survey was based on facetoface interviews with selfdeclared food purchase decision makers all information and statistics that follow originated from the survey korean households claimed to spend an average of per month on food about half of korean households indicated they dine out at least once a week and they tend to choose a foreign restaurant about of the time in contrast to traditional korean culture the data indicates that it has become rare for koreans to invite guests to their homes friends and family members are the most reliable sources of information taken into consideration when purchasing food other important sources cited in descending order of importance are • television and radio household food buyers listed the categories of fresh fruits and vegetables seafood and fish and nonalcoholic beverages as their most frequent purchases the country of origin of food is important to korean consumers and is apparently considered in every food and cooking related situation koreans prefer korean foods over imported foods although they are open to foreign alcoholic beverages and meats such as veal and lamb many consumers prefer to purchase meat in specialty stores the most frequently purchased meat is pork followed by poultry and beef the survey implies that of korean households eat some imported beef for those households imported beef accounts for only of their beef purchases of the consumers who eat imported beef thought its origin to be from the united states from australia from new zealand and from canada the remainder did not know the country of origin of their foreign beef other important criteria influencing food purchasing behavior are in descending order of importance • health • taste • nutrition food safety concerns such as bse mad cow disease and avian influenza caused the surveyed consumers to reduce their consumption of beef and poultry between january and april but this appears to be rebounding slowly despite general concerns about food safety most korean consumers tend to trust their retailers and government controls when questioned about their sources of information for food safety information survey participants cited the same sources as for general food information in descending order • friends and family • store displays and signs many koreans show a positive attitude towards canada based on its favourable reputation clean environment and trustworthy and likeable people these factors have put canada above the united states australia and new zealand in the minds of korean consumers the most notable food associated with canada seems to be beef impact on canadian companies food consumers in south korea appear to have a positive image of canada canadian food exporters should use this positive evaluation as a competitive advantage in branding their products canadian companies should focus on developing marketing strategies that emphasize the healthy

previous year to mt opportunities the japanese food processing industry eg vegetable oil processing and flour milling industry is highly oriented to the import market canada is the largest exporter of

produced nearly mt of canola oil in canola oil is the most consumed edible oil in japan followed by soybean oil as production of canola in japan is very limited japanese demand is dependent entirely

to other countries that promote nongm soybeansprimarily canada and brazil there has been new demand for oilseed meals as a substitute for animalorigin meals since the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse infected cattle in japan in september the quality of japanese domestic wheat is generally evaluated as lower than that of imported wheat and so its use is limited primarily to noodle production and as filler since domestic wheat is low in protein flour millers mix it with higher protein imported varieties canada is japans only import source for durum wheat with nearly market share at million in value and around mt by volume canada is now the single largest exporter of barley malt flax and mustard seed to japan japan maintains an overall agricultural selfsufficiency

the ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries maff reannounced a selfsufficiency target of on a caloric basis for japans selfsufficiency consistently declined for many years but has remained steady at since it is doubtful that japan will be able to increase its selfsufficiency significantly for a variety of reasons including the high cost of production and the aging of the farm sector canada is well positioned to cover the gap by supplying high quality agricultural commodity products to japan with the japanese governments implementation of the food hygiene law feed security legislation effective july there has been strong demand for products that meet both the high standards of identity preservation and food and feed safety requirements key participants as a net importer of agricultural commodities products japan relies on foreign suppliers to ensure the provision of important food crops canadas main competitors in key export markets are principally the united states and australia the united states is the largest supplier with over market share in terms of grains oilseeds as a major provider of wheat as well as canola australia is also a key competitor being the third largest supplier of food crops behind canada with around market share these three countries combine to account for of japans total grain and oilseed imports competitors gain an advantage through better harvesting weather only in certain years freight efficiencies especially for the us and by the ability to offer products during canadas offseason australia the japanese food industry including the grain and oilseed processing industry is currently going through a major consolidation and efficiency improvement process for example as of december there were domestic oilcrushing factories in

built the factory canadian position canada continues to be japans leading supplier of canola wheat soybeans forage malt and barley japan has a steady annual demand of between and million mt of canola and over million mt of wheat from canada canada is japans sole supplier of durum wheat canada is well positioned to export food grade soybeans for the japanese food soybean market canadian suppliers have also been successful in the export of cereals and cereal products for many years as the japanese food processing industries are highly concerned with food safety canadian companies may benefit from references to canadas agricultural policy framework which clearly addresses food safety as a priority japan is one of the most reliable markets for food crops and has consistently provided high returns to canadian grain producers and exporters canadian wheat canola soybeans and the other commodity products enjoy a reputation for high quality in japan however there is intense competition from us producers for wheat and soybeans and australia for canola and wheat quality factors that can distinguish the canadian crop from its competitors are extremely valuable for promoting the crop to buyers private and publicsector customers although the japanese agrifood market is open for competition canadian exporters should be aware of the high tariffs applied to most imports of raw materials and valueadded processed foods the japanese food distribution system is characterized by multiple layers of distributors and wholesalersmany of whom specialize in certain productswho have developed close relationships with manufacturers retailers importers and other wholesalers specialized distributors typically handle competing product lines and some or all related promotional activities depending on the specific agreement distributors and wholesalers may also oversee customer support the agricultural commodities trade in japan is traditionally handled by large general trading companies that have tremendous influence in the japanese food industry even though some specialized trading companies are involved in specific sectors such as food soybeans and organic grain products each commodity sector has trade and industry associations unified to lobby their internal and external activities to governmental agencies for example japan oilseed processors association is the vegetable oil crushers organization and the japan flour millers association is the wheat flour millers organization these organizations work closely with their respective trader associations such as the japan oils fats importers association and the japan grain importers association nevertheless choosing the appropriate distributor is still a crucial step in accessing the japanese market it is important to work closely with a japanese partner to ensure that products meet all regulations standards and quality conditions that are essential to operating successfully in japan producers are

requirements for imported processed food products from canada chapter import of livestock products from canada including bovine semen chapter import regulations for pine imports from canada important websites preface india is a signatory to wto and an active member of codex alimentarius commission and other international treaties governing food trade most of the india’s agriculture and food regulations are inline with international guidelines but may not be the same as their trading partners including canada in most of the cases central government can frame the laws but implementation of the law is in the hand of the state governments at the same time state governments are also empowered to make similar laws to address the needs of the local situations as far as food trade is concerned central government has enacted large number of regulations to monitor the trade practices and quality of the food available to the citizens the implementation and enforcement of the law is in the hand of state agencies there are many mandatory regulations and voluntary standards in the food trade in india while doing trade with india exporters must understand various legal provisions because any product sold in india must comply with the legal provisions applicable in india in this document we are highlight the regulations and their approach for governing food import from canada into india territory various chapters of this document cover specific provisions affecting trade with india we are also providing the important website links so that while doing trade with india exporters must check the latest update on the various provisions in the law executive summary this study on indian food laws is prepared on the request of canadian high commission at new delhi great care was taken in its preparation to include the latest modifications in the laws related to food trade and biotechnology policy as you know policies and rules keep changing so this information may not be entirely accurate either because policies may have changed since the report was written or because clear and consistent information is unavailable it is highly recommended that canadian exporters verify import requirements with their foreign customers before goods are shipped final import approval is always subject to the importing country’s rules and regulations as interpreted by border officials at the timeof product entry food related laws all notifications related to trade in food products from and into india are issued by director general of foreign trade dgft these notifications reflect export – import policy or trade policy of india and also the notifications issued by various concerned departments it is important to understand overall importexport policy of india while developing trading relations with india in any sector including food products currently there are more than fifteen laws relating to food which are administered by a number of different ministries and departments of the government of india among the more important food laws are prevention of food adulteration act pfa of and the pfa rules of the objective of this law to protect the nation against impure unsafe and fraudulently labeled foods and is amended from time to time pfa standards and regulations apply equally to domestic and imported products the pfa covers various aspects of food formulation food processing and distribution such as food standard food color preservatives pesticide residues packaging and labeling and regulation of sales the law is enforced by the director general of health services ministry of health and family welfare government of india goi the pfa focuses primarily on the establishment of regulatory standards for primary food products which constitute the bulk of the indian diet the pfa is not always able to keep pace with advances in the food processing sector because of various social and administrative issues pfa rules sometimes appear to be drafted in a manner to establish minimum product quality specifications such as prescribing recipes for how food products should to be manufactured in case there are scientific reasons to amend the standards the concerned parties can appeal to have the pfa rules amendments under pfa the central committee for food standards chaired by the director general of health services is the final decision making entity on pfa rules the appeals process is cumbersome and time consuming all imported products must adhere to the rules as specified in the regulation including the labeling and marking requirements the standards of weights and measures act and standards of weights and measures packaged commodities rule these legislative measures are designed to establish fair trade practices with respect to packaged commodities the rules aim to ensure that the basic rights of consumers regarding vital information about the nature of the commodity the name and address of the manufacturer the net quantity date of manufacture and maximum sale price are provided on the label besides standards of weights and measures act and standards of weights and measures packaged commodities rule there are additional labeling requirements for food items covered under the pfa act and rules the department of consumer affairs in the ministry of consumer affairs food and public distribution is the regulatory authority for the standards of weights and measures act and standards of weights and measures packaged commodities rule and subsequent notifications importers of packaged food products must adhere to these acts including labeling the product the name and address of the importer the net quantity date of manufacture bestbefore date and maximum sale price must be included on the label the fruit products order the fruit and vegetable processing sector is regulated by the fruit products order fpo which is administered by the ministry of food processing industries the fpo contains specifications and quality control requirements regarding the production and marketing of processed fruits and vegetables sweetened aerated water vinegar and synthetic syrups all such processing units are required to obtain a license under the fpo and periodic inspections are carried out processed fruit and vegetable products imported into the country must meet the fpo standards please note in case of variation in the product standard between the fruit products order and pfa rule the pfa rule will apply meat food products order this order administers the permissible quantity of heavy metals preservatives and insecticide residues for meat products the new regulatory authority for this order is ministry of food processing industries this order is equally applicable to domestic processors and importers of meat products however its implementation is weak due to unorganized production in the domestic market and few imports livestock importation act under the livestock importation act the government laid down procedures for the importation of livestock and products to india which is implemented by the department of animal husbandry and dairying ministry of agriculture under this act any importer importing any livestock product needs prior permission based on sanitary status of the country of origin and type of product milk and milk products order this order regulates the production distribution and supply of milk products establishes sanitary requirements for dairies machinery and premises and sets quality control standards for milk and milk products standards specified in the order also apply to imported milk products the department of animal husbandry and dairying ministry of agriculture is the regulatory authority for this order the implementing agency is the directorate of plant protection quarantine and storage under the department of agriculture and cooperation ministry of agriculture based on the feedback and experience this act is amended from time to time labeling requirements for food products part vii of the pfa rules and the standards of weights and measures packaged commodities rules as amended lay down labeling requirements for all packaged foods the label should provide the information related to name trade name or description contained in the package name of ingredients used in the product in descending order of their composition by weight or volume name and complete address of manufacturer packer importer or vendor and country of origin of the imported food if the food article is manufactured outside india and packed in india net weight number or volume of contents distinctive batch lot or code number month and year the product was manufactured or packed month and year by which the product is best consumed maximum retail price mrp every package of food which contains permitted artificial sweetener shall carry the label contains artificial sweetener and for calorie conscious along with the name or trade name of the product there are special labeling requirements for certain packaged food items such as infant foods condensed milk milk powder blended vegetable oils etc in the case of imported packaged food all declarations may be printed on a label securely affixed to the package or may be made on an additional wrapper containing the imported package or may be printed on the package itself or may be made on a card or tape affixed firmly to the package or container and bearing the required information prior to customs clearance the responsibility for labeling lies with the importer and should be done before products are presented for custom clearance all packaged commodities imported into india should carry the following declarations residual shelf life of the imported product shelf life of the product is to be calculated based on the declaration given on the label of the product regarding the date of manufacture and the due date of expiry however there are no statutory nutritional requirements although there is no official position on implied andor health claims such claims should be able to withstand verification by a court of law if challenged packaging and container requirements all weights or measures are to be reported in metric units imported processed foods containing coloring matter preservatives food additives etc should conform to the regulations contained in the pfa rules pfa act also prohibits the sale of fresh fruits and vegetables coated with waxes both edible and nonedible mineral oils and colors pesticides and other contaminants the pfa rules include a positive list for the presence of pesticide residues in various commodities and food manufacturedimported products and their respective tolerance levels the codex mrls may be accepted for imported foodstuffs only for those pesticides not included in india’s positive list of pesticides other regulations and requirements for imported food products product registration is not required for imported products all imported foods are randomly sampled at the port of entry for their conformity to pfa standards the ministry of commerce and industry published a list of high risk food items imports of which will be subject to percent sampling with immediate effect the list includes edible oils and fats pulses and pulse products cereal and cereal products milk powder condensed milk food colors and food additives among other items the import of product samples via express mail or parcel post is allowed contingent on obtaining prior permission from the directorate general of foreign trade mail order imports are not allowed once the products enter the domestic market they are to be monitored randomly at the retailwholesale level by the respective regulatory authorities foodingredients and additives containing bioengineered organisms shall not be produced used or imported without the approval of the geac all such approvals if granted shall be for a specific period not exceeding four years at the first instance and renewable for years at a time subject to terms and conditions product specific food standards appendix b of the pfa rules and the fruit products order as amended contain definitions and specific quality standards for certain food products such as processed cheese ice cream spice mixes milk and milk products infant food vegetable oils and margarine fruits and vegetable products and basic food items like wheat rice and pulses mandatory bis certification on sensitive food products department of commerce notification no re dated november requires imports of certain products including some food products milk powder condensed milk infant milk foods milkcereal based weaning foods and food additives to comply with mandatory indian quality standards all manufacturers and exporters whose products are sold in india are required to register with the bureau of indian standards ipr protection ie copyright andor trademark indian law is supposed to provide rigorous protection for copyrighted material the indian copyright act of is based on the bernconvention on copyrights to which india is a party may and december amendments increased protection and introduced stiffmandatory penalties for copyright infringement the foreign trademarks are recognized in india foreign firms can register their trademarks through a local agent by applying at the office of registrar of trademarks importers are required to furnish an import declaration in the prescribed bill of entry format disclosing full details of the value of imported goods this must be accompanied by any import licenses and phytosanitary certificates in case of agricultural commodities along with documentation such as sales invoices and freight and insurance certificates all consignments are required to be inspected prior to clearance in the current customs setup appointing a clearing agent avoids delays the clearance of imported food products at the port of entry requires a certification from the port health authority that the product conforms to the standards and regulation of the pfa or other relevant laws and rules however certification is based mostly on visual inspection and records of past imports as most ports have very limited testing facilities and storage infrastructure consequently importers of new products can sometimes face undue delays in clearing their products the custom clearance period may vary from one day to one month depending on the product and experience of the importer imports from canada in to india are free unless regulated imports from canada shall be free except in cases where they are regulated by the provisions of this policy or any other law for the time being in force the item wise import policy shall be

demand for assorted products and services bangladesh is rich in natural resources and has a thriving agricultural sector that dominates the economy during the early ’s bangladesh embarked on an economic stabilization program which has since made strides in improving economic stability and possibility as economic improvements continue bangladesh can rely on its endowments of a vast human resources base rich land abundance of water and considerable natural gas reserves to carry it through this slow but steady development process bangladesh has also made improvements in its standards of living other notable advancements include reducing population growth gender equality within the school system and improvement of the health care system annual gdp growth has remained steady in past years although it is estimated that growth needs to expand by at least two percentage points to significantly reduce the poverty that afflicts many residents canada bangladesh relations canada has maintained a strong relationship with bangladesh since it gained independence in in bangladesh was the top asian recipient of canadian aid in january of the canadian government granted virtually open

dramatically after seeing a decline in canada’s agrifood exports rebound from the total of million to reach million in but there was a slight drop in to million due to a large decrease in lentil exports these fluctuations reflect the changing needs of the bangladeshi market more than external competit ion while did see a decrease there were some positive aspects to the statistical totals canada’s largest agrifood export commodity has consistently been wheat accounting for over million in each of the past years canada is bangladesh’s th largest wheat supplier imports from bangladesh

investment in bangladesh by providing guarantees in the improvement of manufacturing and financial infrastructure • bangladesh’s nongovernmental organizations ngo are amongst the most active in the world they operate throughout the country and focus on poverty alleviation and development • half the population lives above the poverty line bangladesh country report august other highly populated cities include chittagong and rajshahi dhaka and chittagong are by far the largest consumer markets in the country about of the urban population is considered middle class capable of purchasing processed and imported foods and this class is growing the middle class has an average household income of us • in rural bangladesh rice i a staple component of the diet and often eaten at s every meal the rural population does not consume processedimported foods the demand for processed foods in urban areas is rapidly increasing a large number of foreigners reside in dhaka and other metropolitan areas in bangladesh and make up a large portion of the consumer base for imported fresh and processed items the majority of the population prefers fresh food items that are cooked at home consumption of pulses has been rapidly increasing and the current domestic supply is not meeting demand this presents an opportunity for canadian exporters bangladesh imports approximately us million of fresh and dry fruit per year as they are popular items amongst bangladeshi consumers bangladeshi’s consume a lot of chicken beef mutton and fish but they are only self sufficient in poultry production bangladesh is a muslim dominated society and therefore imported meat will not be consumed unless it is halal the bangladeshi consumer base is considered to be price sensitive however they are increasingly quality conscious bangladesh is a major importer of wheat as it is part of their staple diet and th imports about million tones annually canada is current ly bangladesh largest import supplier of wheat but opportunity exists for canada to export more as projections for increased consumption are projected into there are many types of retail shops in bangladesh the most common are the small roadside shops followed by municipal corporation markets which are mainly found in semi urban or urban areas supermarkets are growing in popularity but are fairly new to bangladesh’s retail sector with the first outlet opening only years go supermarkets are concentrated in major cities and carry a variety of imported products august competitors canada’s largest competition for the bangladeshi market comes from india bangladesh’s largest agrifood import supplier their relationship was made stronger with the signing of a trade agreement in june in which both countries agreed to remove existing trade barriers bangladesh participated in this agreement largely to address the us billion trade deficit they have with india bangladesh is also a member of the south asia free trade agreement which created a free trade zone between india pakistan nepal sri lanka bangladesh bhutan and the maldives aside from neighboring countries canada’s western competition for the bangladesh agrifood market come s from australia us italy and the uk these countries already have a strong trade relationship with bangladesh and are large suppliers of fruit juices powdered milk fresh and dried fruits olive oil and coffee to bangladesh the main consumers for goods imported from western countries is the middle class and the foreign population while neighboring countries cater to the rural population and therefore the two markets do not compete directly bangladesh is a founding member of the world trade organization wto where it is active in representing the interests of the least developed countries in the world and bangladesh is also a member of good standing in the south asia preferential trade agreement sapta as well bangladesh is a member of the bay of bengal initiative for multisectoral technical and economic cooperation bimstec an organization that seeks to promote economic cooperation between bangladesh india burma myanmar sri lanka and thailand bangladesh’s other large agrifood suppliers include singapore at and australia at • tariff rates have been significantly reduced but as they are a major source of government revenue they are still fairly high poor infrastructure makes the shipping of fresh and refrigerated products to bangladesh difficult all plants seeds and livestock require certificates of health issued by an approved authority from the country of origin the government is attempting to diversify the economy and move towards a market oriented economy to avoid heavy reliance on a sector that is typically vulnerable to natural disasters such as cyclones droughts and floods producing enough food to sustain bangladesh’s growing economy is a major goal of the agriculture sector as bangladesh still relies on imports to meet domestic demands especially during years when yields are inadequate a persistent problem in bangladesh’s agricultural sector is in the ownership of land islamic heritage laws have affected land division making landholdings increasingly small and often split between different areas this division and separation has made maximizing production difficult some farmers have faced problems with the current irrigation system as at times the water supply is contaminated bangladesh farmers depend on imported seeds for agricultural products and there is a particularly high demand for hybrid seeds bangladesh’s agricultural sector is legislated by the government and thus fluctuates with domestic production and changing import requirements the government does not plan to reform or restructure the agriculture sector in the near future bangladesh’s major crops include rice jute tea wheat cane oilseeds potatoes beef milk poultry tobacco pulses and spices bangladesh is the world’s largest producer

per cent of the national total of which km is suitable for navigation by vessels of dwt or more in addition to the major rivers there is the ancient beijinghangzhou grand canal with a current

world bank loan is being directed towards a usd million project aimed at bringing a greater hope for prosperity to a region where million people live at subsistence level a large part of these funds

allowed to combine two points in mainland china in one service and enter into codeshare arrangement on all routes between the hong kong sar and mainland china the government says it will intensify efforts to stimulate growth through spending on infrastructure such as water supply and power grids and poverty relief and through rural tax reform accession to the world trade organization helps strengthen china’s ability to maintain strong growth rates but at the same time puts additional pressure on the hybrid system of strong political controls and growing market influences china’s growing openness to the world economy and the development of port services in many other coastal cities has increased the competitive pressure on the service industries of the hong kong sar per capita gdp of the hong kong sar compares well with that of the major economies of western europe gdp growth averaged a strong per year between but the hong kong sar suffered two recessions in the past years because of the asian financial crisis in and the global downturn of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak also battered the hong kong sars economy but a boom in tourism from the mainland a return of consumer confidence and a solid rise in exports resulted in the resumption of strong growth in late c the macau sar macaus relatively affluent economy has remained one of the most open in the world since its reversion to china in macau’s net exports of goods and services account for roughly of its gdp with tourism and apparel exports as the mainstays although the macau sar was hit hard by the asian financial crisis and the global downturn in its economy grew in a rapid rise in the number of mainland visitors drove the recovery much of macaus textile industry may move to the mainland as the multifiber agreement is phased out and the sar may have to rely more on gambling and traderelated services to generate growth determinants of food demand quantitatively the rate of increase in the demand for agricultural agrifood seafood products is influenced by the rates of change of population product prices income per person and changes in income distribution table compares china as a whole with the hong kong and macau sars with respect to population growth and gdp per person qualitatively the types of products demanded by consumers are determined by their tastes and preferences which are in turn determined by the historical cuisine and their knowledge and acceptance of foreign cuisines income level also has an influence on the level of quality demanded a china in china as a whole population is increasing at about the same low rate as in the hong kong and macau sars but the size of the population is much larger the level of income inequality on an individual basis is measured by the gini ratio of compared to canada the size of the population and the rate at which gdp per person is increasing indicates that china as a whole is a major consumer of food and per capita consumption will increase rapidly b the hong kong sar the hong kong sar has a small population compared to china as a whole and it is growing at about the same rate however it has a much higher gdp per person than china as a whole due to competition from other chinese cities the hong kong sar’s gdp per person is actually decreasing and food consumption per person will probably not increase significantly c the macau sar the macau sar is a very small market but has characteristics that may be of interest to some canadian food exporters gdp per person is increasing slower than china as a whole and would not be an attractive target for most canadian food exporters table similarly high levels of technology and modern management skills in food processing are not widespread from january to may the value of the hkd was decreasing at a rate of per month per year this drop in value is making canadian food products increasingly expensive for hong kong consumers risk factors a internal politicaleconomic events the new political class referred to as the fourth generation of politicians is expected to give stability to china through it is expected to pursue a policy of gradual opening and modernization of the country which aims at maintaining economic growth and narrowing the large wealth gaps between the eastern and western areas of china risk to canadian agrifood seafood exporters will increase if the country is not able to resolve these issues and if the difficulties of the past continue excessively manipulative bureaucracy payment difficulties trade barriers tariff and nontariff in recent years the chinese economy has been growing very quickly in the year ending june the country’s gdp grew at early in investment was increasing at per year and bank lending has been rising very quickly these conditions are fuelling a property if a major inflation occurs china’s imports will not increase at the same rate as in recent years and may actually decrease in this event canadian agrifood seafood exporters may experience a lack of effective demand in china in the next few years b external politicaleconomic events the external risk factors are linked to two issues i china’s relations with the usa and ii the effect of epidemics income from tourism was lost trade exhibitions and business meetings etc were cancelled such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic such a pandemic is likely to begin in asia and china might be severely affected resulting in losses similar to those experienced during the concern over sars this insurance normally covers the standard risks involved in transporting goods such as accidents and weather if a canadian exporter expects to incur costs or receive payment in cnys or hkds heshe may want to consider hedging against currency risks by participating in the futures market this strategy is not appropriate in all situations and the exporter should obtain advice from a bank or other trusted expert the availability terms and costs of this insurance will depend on conditions in the importing country the reputation of the importer and edc policy generally the accounts receivable insurance will cover up to of losses resulting from a wide range of commercial and political risks including insolvency or default of the buyer payment delay caused by blockage of funds or transfer difficulties refusal of

and do business in it is still not an easy market but many barriers to trade are being removed the accession of china to the wto and internal changes such as the increasing importance of the private sector and the privatization of some state owned companies are producing considerable wealth in the eastern parts of the country this increased economic activity coupled with china’s large population is creating a very significant market for all types of products including agricultural agrifood seafood products with the introduction of modern methods of production and processing china has the potential to be a large producer of food products its own population will be the major consumers of china’s food production but many products in which it has a comparative advantage will be exported as incomes increase china will become increasingly significant as a market for canadian food products if they are of a type and quality desired by chinese consumers distributors and can compete on price statistics indicate that in the value of china’s imports of agricultural agrifood seafood products from canada was more than double that of in canada was tenth after malaysia australia thailand

choosing to enter the china market with their product or expand their existing services in canadian exports to china were valued at approximately of chinas total imports making canada the th largest trading partner with china in the total canadian food export to china reached million of which entered through or to shanghai the total fisheryseafood export to china in was million in which entered through or to shanghai in the first three months of canadian exports to china reached million for the canadian exporter distribution is one of the largest challenges chinas sheer geographic size complicated distribution industry and regional differences make national distribution a challenging and daunting task establishing a comprehensive thorough distribution system is critical for success in the chinese market china is in a period of transition its accession to the world trade organisation wto has created significant new opportunities for canadian exporters and has facilitated access to the chinese market the chinese import process has been streamlined and has become increasingly transparent infrastructure projects are blossoming a strong consumer culture is emerging and a penchant to try new imported products is developing chinas distribution system has evolved drastically over the last two decades with free market principles at work the system has undergone the necessary changes to compete in the world market place although stateowned companies control the majority of distribution they are limited to distributing bulk and certain niche commodities strong private sector distributors and wholesalers have emerged to meet the demands of foreign import products and exporters employing a private distributor is the most common method used by canadian exporters though improvements are constant the transportation infrastructure is inadequate the distribution industry fragmented the legal system underdeveloped and the banking structure opaque these barriers can have a negative impact on the import process canadian companies are strongly advised to perform due diligence before entering the market this report is designed to provide canadian companies with a comprehensive overview of the distribution system in china and the challenges associated with distribution a dedicated canadian company with the right combination of product and strategy can penetrate and be successful in the market nationwide distribution is obtainable with the right strategy and a little creativity map of the yangzi delta region anhui population gdp per capita expenditure on food jiangsu populatoin gdp per capita expenditure on food shanghai population gdp per capita expenditure on food zhejiang population gdp per capita expenditure on food regional overview east china also known as the yangzi delta region is a major importer of canadian agricultural commodities canadian exports of grains oilseeds and live seafood are among canadas top ten exports to east china the city of shanghai is one of the best potential markets in china for imported and valueadded foods the canadian consulates agfood team places strong emphasis on promoting canadian processed foods in this market the neighbouring provinces of jiangsu zhejiang and anhui provide excellent opportunities for agricultural technologies including farming animal genetics food processing and seafoodfishery processing and aquatics it should be noted that with the rapid development of logistics and infrastructure networks in the yangzi delta second tier cities in the region such as hangzhou wenzhou nanjing suzhou wuxi and hefei are increasingly viewed as potential markets for imported foods shanghai the market for imported food products in shanghai is developing rapidly in shanghai opened its first supermarket prior to that date food shopping was primarily carried out in wet markets or governmentowned dry goods stores today there are modern retail outlets operating in the city each over square metres in size of which were established in alone four of the top ten supermarket companies in china are headquartered in shanghai in the past distribution was a main challenge for foreign importers the system was fraught with bad infrastructure and inadequate food storage facilities of late there have been significant improvements in this area the governments of shanghai and the surrounding provinces have invested significantly in developing regional transportation infrastructure accessing smaller villages or hamlets can still be difficult but the infrastructure provides good coverage to major regional centres improvements in retailing and warehousing capabilities are also noteworthy the per capita gdp in shanghai reached us and the gdp growth rate reached both at the top in china of this percentage close to is spent on dining out shanghais drive to become an international city has heightened the citys growth key events such as the expo in shanghai will accelerate the flow of investment and people into the city from both international and domestic sources as a result shanghai will continue to be an ideal market for highquality processed or imported food products shanghais vibrant hospitality industry modern distribution systems established retail system and adventurous consumers are creating significant opportunities for canadian exporters there are currently local importers or distributors in shanghai that regularly import processed food from canada canadian products are perceived as clean natural safe and of good quality canadian seafood especially live seafood and fishery products are particularly welcomed according to aafc statistics the total amount of chinese imports from canada reached million dollars approximately of canadian exports entered china through the port of shanghai grains barley and oil seeds account for the most significant share of canadas total exports to china while processed food exports are minimal however the combination of chinas accession to the world trade organization wto and a growing interest in foreign foods is leading to increased demand for processed food products in the region provinces of jiangsu zhejiang and anhui these three provinces have strong agricultural capabilities local governments have emphasised the development of local agricultural infrastructure and production technologies and have accordingly allocated significant investment funds urban dwellers in these three provinces are using their new purchasing power to demand increasingly highquality food products either from the shanghai market or imported directly from overseas countries consequently consumer demand is spurring the local development of the food processing industries several companies have already emerged in the local food and beverage processing sector such as the yurun group in nanjing meat the wahaha group in hangzhou beverages and the qiaqia group in hefei native chinese produces canada has enjoyed significant success in the animal husbandry sector in the region particularly in zhejiang province due to two cidafunded projects focused on breeding dairy cattle and lean swine farming agricultural technologies food processing swinedairybeef genetics animal feed and fishaquatic also have great potential in these markets the usa is the largest exporter of processed foods and agricultural technologies to china australia the uk new zealand and several southeast asian countries are also active in the market percentage of shanghai households grouped by disposable income shanghai statistical yearbook per capita annual living expenditure of urban households shanghai shanghai statistical yearbook in canadian exports accounted for approximately of chinas total imports food exports grains barley and oil seeds account for the significant share of canadas total exports whereas processed valueadded food exports are minimal however with the combination of chinas market reforms and the growing interest in imported food they have risen in the last years food purchases represent the largest expenditure of consumer spending urban households currently spend of their annual living expenditure on food purchases of this per cent close to is spent on dining out recreation and education represent the second biggest expenditure with only in the following food products were reported to have sold well in the shanghai and the yangzi delta market and are expected to ontinue to provide future opportunities for canadian companies • fish and seafood • processed meat • dairy products • wine and beverages • confectionery • nutraceutical foods however the chinese market is not an easy market to enter the key to success is recognising that opportunities lie in specific regions and income groups significant time and effort needs to be dedicated in researching and formulating a market entry strategy making assumptions based on other markets may prove costly when applied in china a key success factor is to be attentive and to address local market needs shanghai consumers are sensitive to issues of convenience sanitation flavour nutrition and price consumers are willing to pay a premium price for foods viewed as higher quality nutritious and imported shanghais drive to become an international city has heightened the citys growth key events such as expo in shanghai and the beijing olympics will accelerate the money and people flow into the city by both foreign local and government sources as a result shanghai will continue to represent an ideal market for processed and imported food products for the right product and strategy opportunities exist with careful planning dedication and consideration canadian exporters can be successful in the market importation chinas recent accession to the wto has created significant new opportunities for canadian exporters and has facilitated access to the chinese market lower tariff rates transparent reporting systems and international standards are creating an increasingly favourable trading environment the importation system and procedures have greatly improved over the last five years nevertheless there are still significant challenges and barriers the main hurdles are clearing quarantine obtaining the correct paperwork and adjusting to the new system at present the chinese government is in the process of reforming their systems and implementing new ones the transition period has created confusion as companies need to scramble to become compliant with new laws in addition an increasing number of new nontariff barriers are applied during the import process further complicating the procedure quarantine for foreign food exporters the largest challenge and hurdle begins with the quarantine and health inspection the general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine aqsiq in beijing is the national bureau responsible for the inspection and quarantine of any export or import of animal plant and foodstuff products they are also responsible for creating technical standards policies and regulations regional offices are established throughout the country to assist with implementation but have no influence on creating or approving regulations the shanghai entryexit inspection and quarantine shciq normally inspects all agriculture or agrifood products once they arrive at the port of shanghai exemptions and sampling rates are determined based on the history of the importer or exporter the products involved and the volume challenges associated with the aqsiq include import licenses labelling regulations lack of transparent regulations nonscientific quarantine bureaucracy and inflexibility of the bureau exporters largest complaint is that the detention of products is done on an unscientific basis using regulations against the wto and that few chinese producers can meet the largest example is genetically modified food products and pathogenfree meats in most cases there are no written documents stating the requirements for dairy and meat products additional regulations apply china has official protocols with canada for export of beef and pork products from canada aqsiq requires a chinese inspector visit and assess the foreign meat processing plant once approved the plant is granted permission to export their product to china currently there are canadian meat plants approved to export their product this process is managed by the canadian food inspection agency cfia who in turn works with aqsiq to arrange their inspection and approval chinese customs chinese customs is an implementation organisation it simply enforces the laws and regulations created from various chinese government departments customs is responsible for assessing tariffs quotas and verifying appropriate licenses exporters and foreign business in shanghai quote the largest improvement has occurred within chinese customs the importexport process has been streamlined and general transparency increased customs have written documents and have held workshops outlining the customs procedure with proper documentation clearing products is relatively easy whereas clearing a good once took weeks today the average time is days classing systems and electronic data interchange edi are allowing certain companies to further fast track their goods challenges associated with chinese customs are inflexible working hours bureaucratic nature nontariff barriers hs classification national favouritism and custom duties clearing the product once the shipment arrives at the point of entry the imported products undergo the following before being released from aqsiq and customs inspection and quarantine by the aqsiq – the process is normally done at the port of entry or at the importers bonded warehouse they test for pesticides antibiotics visible and nonvisible problems aqsiq will also ensure the label is correct if approved aqsiq issues a pass certificate the product is inspected by chinese customs chinese customs verifies the packing list commercial invoices and shipping documents they classify the good and determine the amount of duty to pay they are also responsible for checking the quality weight and quantity once all the correct documentation and payment is received customs will release the product to the importer other players there are various government departments involved in importing goods to china the minister of agriculture moa is responsible for the development and safety of the chinese agriculture sector they are central in formulating regulations governing genetically modified organisms gmo chinas rules require safety certificates stating gmo products are not harmful to humans animals or the environment exporting companies must now provide scientific experiments demonstrating the product is safe for consumption once the product is determined safe the minister of agriculture will issue a safety certificate it is the responsibility of the exporting company to declare the use of gmo in their products the aqsiq has the right to search and examine the product if they determine genetically modified products the product will not enter china and will be handled accordingly the original gmo regulation was issued in january under a united states brokered deal the chinese government agreed to issue interim certificates while exporters performed the necessary tests and the chinese finalised the details since then interim certificate have been extended from the initial december deadline to september and recently to april north american farmers are particularly negatively affected by the gmo regulation the majority of the american soybean crop and the canadian rapeseed crops are genetically modified the opponents claim chinas regulation has no scientific basis going against wto regulations on agriculture the chinese government is stalling to provide time for chinese farmers to cultivate their own industry extensive lobbying on the american and chinese government continues to occur in efforts to change the current regulations soybeans are particularly sensitive as no quota system dictates their flow tariff rate quotas apply to bulk such as wheat and canola the minister of health determines and approves functional food products functional foods are defined as any products possessing health care functions but are limited in the purpose of curing diseases importers are required to apply to the minister of health for a functional foods certificate and approval number endorsing the safety of the product the application procedure involves functional tests scientific evidence supporting the product and complete lists of ingredients the certificate must accompany the product during the import process and the approval number must be printed on all packaging licensed importers under chinas current trade regulations chinese companies must obtain an import license before entering goods into the country import licenses are issued by the industrial and commercial administration board of the newly founded ministry of commerce the ministry of commerce is a joint government department combining the old bureau responsible for external trade the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation moftec and the bureau responsible for internal trade the state economic and trade commission setc currently full import licenses are only available to large stateowned and domestic private companies private chinese companies must meet certain criteria import levels annual revenue and number of employees before qualifying for an import license full import licenses allow companies to sell directly to the public act as an agent for a smaller chinese or foreign distributors who do not possess a license import goods for internal manufacturing and import materials for manufacturing also these companies have access to foreign capital foreign distributors joint venture companies jv and wholly owned foreign enterprises wofe can only import goods for internal manufacturing and materials for the manufacturing process they cannot function as a trader to resell the imported products directly to another buyer or the enduser as a result jvs wofes and smaller chinese companies commission an import agent company with a full license to import goods on their behalf once cleared they are free to distribute the product and sell directly to end consumer the import agent will also organise payment for the goods to the foreign party restrictions on import licenses are scheduled to be removed in jvs are permitted to obtain import licenses followed by wofes in the import licence system will be abolished completely in import tariffs and value added tax chinas accession to the wto has resulted in a significant reduction of tariffs on key agriculture and agrifood commodities on average tariffs for all goods range from to a decrease from their original levels in agricultural tariffs will be cut from to tariff reductions will occur over the period of the next three years in addition a valueadded tax vat is applied to all products entering into the market from abroad though improved the vat plus the tariff can significantly increase the cost of the import the following chart demonstrates the tariff rate and the vat on key import products the vat is on unprocessed unpackaged food and on processed packaged food fruit vegetable mixture of fruit juices tomatoes fresh or chilled confectionary chocolate bars maple sugar syrup functional foods american ginseng grain oilseeds meat products beef frozen cuts poultry frozen pork fresh food labelling effective november all imported and exported food products must adhere to the chinese labelling regulations all food labels must be inspected verified and issued a certificate of import export food labelling by the aqsiq aqsiq specified laboratories will test the food nutrition and quality to ensure that the label is accurate an approval certificate is required prior to applying for goodsarrival inspection and other customs formalities shanghai applications can be submitted to the shciq they will perform the initial testing and submit it to the aqsiq for final approval if all the correct documentation is provided approval of the label should be issued within working days one application can be submitted for the same product ingredient package and the only difference is the weight the importer can import the goods only once the aqsiq approval certificate is received all packaged food products international or local products must be affixed with a chinese language label indicating the following • name of the food • ingredient table • net contents on the packaged volume or weight • name and address of the importer and manufacturer • production and expiry date • storage directions • country of origin labelling refers to all written language graphs symbols layout and explanation materials of packaged food products all chinese language must be in simplified chinese characters please see the appendix b for a copy of the registration form label stickers can be used providing they have received the aqsiq approval the stickers cannot be detached from the product the size of the english characters cannot exceed that of the chinese import route the most common method to import products to the chinese market is to work with a local distributor or wholesaler the chinese party will arrange all custom formalities import licenses paperwork and distribution of your product canadian companies avoid the hassles of customs logistics and distribution as identified above the distributor does not need to actually possess a licence to import the product as they employ government certified company private or stateowned to import goods on their behalf additional distribution methods and challenges will be discussed in the proceeding section in the past many goods entered china by using a series of grey channels though this has declined significantly it is still common for certain goods as ginseng or fruit products grey channel products are subject to less duty avoid quarantine and the time delay involved with the official route the chinese government has taken significant steps in the past years to halt smuggling and curtail grey channels companies are strongly advised not to use such illegal routes to enter china points to remember • the import process has become increasingly streamlined and transparent with the proper paper work a hasslefree fast clearance is possible • certain products such as gmos grain oilseeds nutraceuticals and meat products require special licenses before entering the chinese market • ensure the correct certified labelling is placed on all products • the largest hurdle begins with the general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine aqsiq their processes continue to be nontransparent and inflexible • under wto accession import tariffs are scheduled to be reduced the value added tax vat and import tariff attribute to the total cost of export process • canadian exporters work with a local distributor or wholesaler the chinese party arranges custom formalities import licenses paperwork and distribution of your product • avoid all grey and illegal routes into china distribution a glance today the distribution system has evolved drastically eastern coastal cities as shanghai have developed the necessary infrastructure to meet the markets need much needed infrastructure projects industry reorganisation and elimination of restrictions on foreign participation will further improvement nevertheless distribution remains the largest challenge for foreign companies striving to achieve market success it is also the most crucial chinas vast geographical size requires the movement of goods over long distances a daunting task given chinas inadequate transportation infrastructure lack of warehousing facilities and different regional characteristics despite improvements the distribution system remains chaotic and inefficient chinas accession to the wto is expected to improve the current situation the distribution industry will become increasingly open to foreign companies by foreign companies will be granted full trading and import rights industry analysts believe this will be a positive step for the distribution industry foreign operators will introduce new competition infrastructure and management expertise the chinese government will reserve the right to exclusively manage the trade of certain products bulk commodities tobaccos and to maintain restrictions on certain sectors of the transportation industry air the traditional chinese statecontrolled distribution system has been almost abolished the remnants of the old system remain in place but are in the midst of revamping their organisations to compete in the market economy each of these distribution systems offers a unique set of advantages and disadvantages in general private domestic distributors are the most feasible and accessible channels for canadian companies to work with when entering the market for the first time depending on the companys future plans current resources and product line the other methods remain viable options traditional to modern distribution systems traditionally the chinese distribution system was opaque hard to navigate and difficult to maintain control of the product all goods were mandated to enter the country through a stateowned foreign trade corporations ftcs the ftc would subsequently fan them out to provincial city or regional stateowned distributors or wholesalers ftcs were not permitted to sell products directly to the end user as no market forces were at work distributors provided basic services as transportation and some warehousing customer service marketing or sales reporting were non existent the traditional distribution system was divided into three rigid hierarchical levels the first tier concentrated on major cities as shanghai beijing and guanzhou these cities allocated and transported the products to the second tier provincial wholesalers second tier wholesalers were located in the provincial capital or other mediumsize cities in the province these wholesalers delivered the goods to the third tier local wholesalers also large state owned department stores were also considered third tier and were responsible to distribute to the smaller retail stores provincial factories were responsible for the smaller cities townships and villages factories every level of the hierarchy was responsible for meeting a production quota imposed by the state planning commission the ministry of trade since been replaced by the ministry of commerce managed and oversaw the distribution of the products to retail outlets and determined the price for all goods in the market the following graph represents the traditional distribution structure the year marked the breakdown of the traditional stateowned distribution system the majority of the stateowned distributors became private distributors andor wholesalers additionally numerous small private distributors have opened their doors over the years confident in the firstmover concept foreign multinationals have rushed to the market in preparation of future liberalisation foreign companies now operate in the distribution logistics warehousing sales and marketing sectors today only products such as grain or coal continue to be distributed through the traditional system the following graph represents the modern distribution system designated large department stores hotels and large supermarkets are the only actors who can import directly from overseas manufacturers or suppliers significant layers and regulations have been removed exporters are now able to exert more control on the product and penetrate deeper into the market distribution channels companies selling in china whether importing or distributing locally made goods must rely on a combination of distribution channels to reach retailers and consumers especially if they attempt nationwide coverage in general markets are highly regional and different characteristics and regulations apply in each the key to approaching the china market is to treat it as a series of different markets and not just one despite the drawbacks and challenges foreign operators have been successful at creating interim solutions to their distribution woes albeit they are not the most cost efficient and practical foreign operators are increasingly able to reach their target destinations with minimal hassle and within their time frame as identified above the most common distribution methods to import and to distribute products in china are • state owned distributors • foreign based distributors • establishing a local presence one practice may not be enough to achieve deep penetration or nationwide coverage often a combination of different strategies is needed to be successful state owned distributors state owned distributors are commonly used for large bulk commodities barley and canola and niche products wine and spirits requiring specialised import licenses they seldom import small quantities of goods it is estimated that of food imports including bulk commodities enter the country through a state owned distributors often stateowned distributors own their own transportation and logistics companies the shanghai food import export corporation general shanghai fisheries general corporation group monopoly on frozen products shanghai wine spirits and sugar monopoly on alcohol and the shanghai food group are the largest operators in shanghai traditionally state owned distributors were notorious for their inefficiencies and lax service standards today due to increased market competition and entry of global players they have reorganised their operations and have significantly improved the services they offer advantages • access to an established distribution and transportation network • possession of needed import licenses • strong purchasing power and access to foreign capital • connection to government parties disadvantages • specializes in large import orders • high commissions • difficult to maintain control over the product private domestic companies private domestic distributors or wholesalers are the most chosen mode of distribution for valueadded food products distributors represent a series of related but noncompetitive products they provide customs clearance basic distribution warehousing and sales for the product as stated earlier working with a domestic distributor is the most common method for canadian exporters to enter the market the canadian consulate in shanghai can assist in locating a reputable and experienced distributor please see the appendix on canadian food distributors in the yangzi delta for a list of distributors carrying canadian food products in shanghai other sources include the local chamber of commerce word of mouth trade organisations and other canadian government departments another key effective method is to attend trade shows related to your product field distributors circulate among booths looking for potential product ranges shanghai is home to numerous trade shows throughout the year catering to a wide variety of products the largest allpurpose food shows are food and hotel china fhc and sial • competitive prices • knowledge and acceptance of local • geographic scope • close to the end user and can provide quick turnaround time • danger of disloyalty commission based leave for higher paying market product • may not be familiar ith your product or its standards • poor handling and distribution tips for dealing with your distributor • it is important to provide chinese language information to your local distributor this will assist the company in selling the product to both the retail outfit and the endconsumer • one of the largest complaints of local distributors concerning foreign importers is their commitment to the market domestic companies are interested in representing companies who have long term commitment in the market • exporters should provide marketing financing and promotional materials do not assume the distributor will automatically privide this service • working closely with the distributor will help create relationships demonstrate commitment ensure the product is marketed experience in the market and achieve higher sales • establish local staff presence to work and assist distributors foreign based distributor and wholesalers foreignbased distributors offer a fuller and more modern range of distribution services with wider coverage on a multiregional or near national basis they have established arrangements with local governments and local companies to solidify their foundation in most cases they are multinational companies operating in more than one world market and their product range and representative services are not limited to food products they offer a wide range of services from advertising distribution transportation and logistics the better known companies operating in the china market include sims trading jebsen co ltd inchcape plc eac and jdh li fung the key drawbacks to using a foreignbased distributor are the added costs to the company lack of local connections and propensity to carry large niche products higher costs are associated with the use of a foreign presence and the additional services they provide the cost is in turn reflected in the price of the good generally foreign distributors carry international brands recognisable around the world profile of selected foreign distributors in china sales and distribution logistics sims trading • city branches • employs more than staff • distribution network of cities • serving principles kraft • concentrates on consumer goods including food beverage and healthcare • strong in hong kong macao and south china • multiple jv with local wholesalers • establihed jv with guangdong based logistics company • jv with nestle jebson co • long established with more than years experience in hong kong and china • serving principals not limited to food products san pellegrino water blue girl beer • broad range of products from cars and accessories chemicals and industrial equipment • head office in hong kong • warehousing these include establishing a representative office ro joint venture jv or wholly owned foreign enterprise wofe depending on the license a local presence allows the foreign company better control over the marketing pricing distribution and sales of the product direct contact with retailers and market players enhances business relationship furthering potential success each license entails a different application process business scope and setup fees a representative office is the cheapest method to establish market presence applicant companies must be a minimum of a year old and possess a certain level of registered capital depending on the region applications are approved in days and the application cost is approximately cnd a ro license allows the company to rent office space hire employees market the product perform market research provide support service and establish relationships a ro can not issue invoices and receive payment for goods or services provided in china can not manufacturer any goods and can not hire staff directly taxes are based on expenses incurred to circumvent the trading restriction a ro issues invoices from their parent company or a hong kong shell company in addition a ro can not receive an import license and must continue to rely on a local importer and distributors to import the product on their behalf closing a ro is difficult as it requires permission from the chinese bureau joint venture establishments are another option to establish a presence a jv is used when the chinese party can provide beneficial assets technology licenses land infrastructure or the industry is closed to complete foreign participation restaurants bars logistics education there are two forms of jv equity and cooperative in an equity partnership the foreign companies pays the chinese partner a predetermined lump sum in a set time frame often the chinese partner is silent and retains no management control in the company this arrangement is common for the restaurant and bar industry equity joint ventures are based on shareholder and company profits their main drawbacks are lack of full management control and sharing of profits companies entering a jv arrangement are advised to perform due diligence on their chinese partner before undertaking any venture increasingly foreign companies are choosing to open a wofe the licensing arena consulting trading and manufacturing has opened significantly creating a host of new options a wofe allows foreign companies access to chinas cheap labour force better access to the local market and local production rights famous brands as pepsi coke frito lays wrigleys gum dove chocolate bars kit kat are all produced locally manufacturing locally allows for easier distribution lowered prices and greater market awareness wofes have complete control over management distribution sales hiring practices and invoicing taxes are based on profit wofe have the ability to convert local currency to foreign dollars for remittance offshore the key impediment to this option is the required capital involved to obtain a licence and to operate in the chinese market in shanghai the required registered capital is to registered capital can be used as working capital the additional costs of running the operations are applied above this amount • maximum level of control over the product • establish relationships with local contacts • establish long term presence and brand name of the product • legal entity status disadvantages • higer costs associated with establishing an office rent salaries processing • required commitment to the market it is recommended that interested parties consult professional advice before reaching a final decision and commencing application procedures in shanghai there are numerous well qualified knowledgeable consulting companies and lawyers specialising in the above a list of consultants can be obtained by contacting the canadian consulate general in shanghai appointing various distributors in each region of the country is another at relatively low costs this option involves paying a limited number of distributors to sell and distribute the product distributors could effectively handle transportation and logistical coordination the key is to develop a manageable network that is reliable and trustworthy in general distributors are strategically chosen in the south east central east and north central areas of china often beverage including spirits and beer companies key regions key cities and provinces population gdp per capita average per region north central beijing tianjin hebei million cnd cental east jiangsu shandong zhejiang anhui jiangxi shanghai million cnd central hubei hunan henan million cnd north east heilongjiang jilin liaoning million cnd north west shanxi shaanxi xinjiang neimeng gansu qinghai ningxia million cnd south east guangdong fujian hainan million cnd south west sichuan yunnan guizhou guangxi chongqing million cnd evaluating a potential distributor does the distributor have a strong financial background to ensure payment and proper distribution extensive due diligence is required to determine the financial status of the distributor providing they are not competitors suppliers or other clients are often willing to supply information third party credit checking companies offer credit checks does the distributor have a good knowledge of the local business market regulations and import procedures a distributor who is intimately aware of the import procedures and chinese regulations will ensure a smooth transition of the good to the market the history of the company their experience their business activities and a list of their clients international and domestic are good indicators of their performance does the distributor have adequate and maintained facilities warehouse transportation is the distributor physically strong man power infrastructure expertise in general chinese distributors lack adequate storage and transportation systems products with special requirement as cold storage may find it more difficult to find a distributor distributors will advertise modern facilities but as due diligence it is important to either visit the facilities or exactly determine the nature of these does the distributor have an established distribution network depending on the need of your products it is important to choose a distributor who can provide regional coverage a wellconnected and established distributor in one area may have insufficient capacity in a neighbouring area do they offer additional services marketing support sales report do not assume all distributors offer a full set of services additional services as marketing support and sales reports are not common some distributors are willing to assist with marketing the product providing they receive adequate financing and promotional materials what is their current product portfolio are there similar products to yours similar product lines can determine the experience of the distributor in selling your product it will also eliminate any conflicting interests with other products that are too similar does the distributor have all the necessary licenses to operate legally in china review the distributors licenses to ensure they are able to offer the services they advertise and meet you companys needs points to remember • distribution remains the largest challenge for imported products in china • china accession to the wto and improvements in domestic infrastructure are expected to act as a catalyst for future development • stateowned distributors private domestic companies and foreignbased distributors are the main mechanisms to distribute goods in china • a combination of methods may be necessary to distribute the product nationally • a clear examination of the exporters need and longterm vision is advised prior to selecting the right distribution strategy distribution challenges the single greatest challenge of nationwide distribution is the development and management of an effective distribution system achieving a broad and deep penetration of agrifood products in key population centres is a challenge difficulties stem from a variety of problems • legal constraints and regulations • accounts receivable • fragmented distribution system wholesaler distributor retailers • intellectual property rights • outdated or illequipped transportation system • high cost to enter the market establishing a presence price of imported foods • establishing relationships legal constraints and regulations since china has made significant advances in legal reform the increased economic activity foreign investments and foreign companies operating in the market will continue to act as a catalyst to further legal reform under wto china has committed itself to the development of an independent transparent and impartial legal system although china has opened its doors significantly to the outside world significant legal restrictions remain in place for example foreign companies establishing a local presence must obtain the correct licensing requirements licenses narrowly define the activities hiring practices business activities and required capital a company can perform in the market certain industries still require a jointventure partner to open and operate restaurants in addition the use of import licenses is considered a nontariff barrier protectionism remains a problem for international companies accessing the market local governments tend to support the domestic industry to the foreign one protectionist practices occur on a national and provincial level practices include support packages reduced property rental reduced taxes and government assistance in addition laws and regulations are interpreted and applied differently from region to region export subsidies and quota requirements are still employed to develop the domestic industry another key concern for foreign companies operating in the market is dispute resolution under wto requirements china is required to establish a dispute resolution system though improvements have been made international lawyers and foreign companies prefer to settle disputes through business practices or international arbitration centres reasons cited are time and cost of the judicial process lack of judicial independence professional capacity of the judicial system high levels of corruption and lack of real enforcement mechanisms accounts receivable a key legitimate concern for any business is receiving payment for their goods or services unfortunately simply making a sale and signing a contract does not ensure this will occur distributors can be slow in rendering payment for the goods or simply defaulting for various reasons the problem occurs for both foreign and domestic enterprises all to often credit is extended on the strength of relationships and transactions are performed on a cashonly basis exporters who extend credit to their wholesalers or distributors do so at their own risk and our advised to perform their own due diligence the problem is compounded by a weak credit system though in the planning stage there is no national credit information bureau trial run services have begun in shanghai and beijing performing credit assessments can be a daunting task with no central information base financial history and dept repayment is difficult to ascertain various third party service providers as duns bradstreet offer credit assessments the chinese government recognises the need to develop a sound credit system in order to ensure financial stability further economic development and to compete internationally the system is further effected by an underdeveloped judicial system lack of real enforcement mechanism in which to collect defaulted payments a developing banking system and tightly controlled foreign currency please see the section entitled receiving payment for additional details on receiving payment in china fragmented industry the entire distribution process is highly fragmented with many layers of people and organisations between the importer and the end consumer each layer ultimately adds to the price of the item the whole process can be time consuming frustrating and difficult to manage the problem applies equally to chinese based companies fragmentation occurs within distribution wholesaling warehousing suppliers transportation and logistics retail stores are forced to deal with many different wholesalers or distributors to stock their shelves most companies carry a limited product range the main reason is they lack the necessary capabilities licenses finances or warehouse space in addition companies may lack the management skill and manpower to carry a varied line of products adequate warehouse space continues to be a problem distributors or wholesalers often own small quantities or rent from a third party refrigerated capabilities or special requirements are difficult to find in such opportunities exist for companies offering specialized services intellectual property rights a key element of chinas wto membership is adherence to trips trade related aspects of intellectual property rights china is also a member to the berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works and the paris convention on patents and trademarks membership to these international organisations has not yet corrected the problem though the government is trying to stem the problem it lacks the enforcement capabilities and the system to be effective china continues to be a haven for counterfeit goods it is estimated that of the consumer goods on the market are fake food products are no exception a recent survey by the china national administration for industry and commerce estimated sold in restaurants and hotels are fake the problem is significantly better in beijing and shanghai as counterfeit products are generally of lesser quality their appearance on the market can seriously undermine the real brand and the company while exporters have little control over the reproduction steps can be taken to ensure better protection foreign companies are encouraged to register their trademark with the state administration of industry and commerce saic trademark office saic is responsible for registration and enforcement of trademark laws in china trademarks are granted on first come first serve basis patents are registered at a separate office the state intellectual property office issues and enforces patent laws while registration does not ensure counterfeiting will not occur it provides the legal backing should it take place exporters are advised to contact an intellectual property lawyer for further information on the process and the fees involved points to remember • protectionist practices continue to be an issue at both the national and local level of government • disputes are normally settled through international arbitration centres as the chinese judicial system is still in a process of development and transformation • determining the distributors or wholesalers ability to pay is difficult as no national credit information bureau or real enforcement mechanism exists • the distribution system is fragmented with many different actors between the product source and end user • copyright and trademark violation continues to be an issue in the chinese market place though no absolute protection is guaranteed steps can be taken to ensure counteraction receiving payment receiving payment from your chinese buyers should be given special attention export risks can be minimised depending on the method of payment payment terms should be well negotiated understood and mutually accepted between the canadian exporter and the chinese company before any trade transactions occurs as the chinese government maintains tight control over foreign currency exchange and the remnibi is a closed currency it is important to ensure that the chinese importer can access foreign currency using an established reputable distributor or buyer should mitigate this problem the possible methods of payment include in order of risk payment upon receipt consignment letter of credit and payment in advance • payment upon receipt should only be pursued if a longterm relationship has been established with the chinese buyer and extensive due diligence has been performed to establish credibility money is commonly transferred using a telegraphic transfer tt • payment on consignment is received only when the goods have been sold in the market if the chinese buyer is inexperienced with import goods or is not convinced the product will sell well consignment may be their preferred payment option alternative payment arrangements may ensue depending on the success of the product • the most common and encouraged method of payment is a letter of credit lc a lc is a letter from the chinese importers bank confirming and guaranteeing the payment once the goods and proper documentation bill of lading are received a lc can be issued based on receipt or on a term basis exporters are protected as they are guaranteed payment for their goods the bank of china has an established lc program a good reputation and is recognised for their neutrality other issuing banks include the peoples construction bank the industrial and commercial bank of china icbc the agricultural bank of china the bank of communications and foreign banks with branch offices hsbc citibank standard chartered in china it is important to note that obtaining a confirmed letter of credit is impossible as china does not allow letters of credit issued by its banks to be confirmed by others chinese or foreign • payment in advance is the less risky financing option for the canadian exporter exporters are assured payment and have the added working capital prior to the goods delivery depending on the contract a down payment is often negotiated as a guarantee of later payment advance payments are common for seafood or high value goods in general chinese buyers are not willing to pay in advance for goods transportation infrastructure logistics freight transportation in china depending on the nature of the product and the company transportation is a key element in achieving success for your product and should not be overlooked great strides have been made to improve transportation infrastructure in shanghai and other eastern coastal cities good roads frequent trains and waterways also connect the major cities in the neighbouring provinces though improvements have been made in transportation and logistics retail demand and chinas own export market have grown at a faster pace distributing westward nationally or away from regional hubs continues to cause significant challenges the infrastructure system is archaic undeveloped and overburdened with users coordination between different modes of transportation and provincial interpretation of regulations are also problems at the moment there are four different government bodies regulating air water rail and road provincial protectionism impedes the development of the system and adds to transportation costs the american chamber of commerce predicts that logistic costs are often more than of the product cost compared to in most developed countries another estimate by morgan stanley places the damage rate at or higher for goods damage is caused by excessive handling and inadequate infrastructure added costs include highway tolls corruption vehicle repairs protectionist practices and unpredictable delays creativity is required when incorporating transportation into a distribution system while there is no blanket approach some companies have strategically established regional distribution centres to effectively warehouse and distribute their products while others outsource the entire transport process to a third party logistics company others string together various local licenses and modes of transport to reach the end destination companies need to choose the system which works best for their product and their future strategies infrastructure will continue to improve the development of an efficient transportation and logistic industry is necessary to sustain chinas own economic growth rate recognising this need the chinese government has committed financial resources to develop the nations infrastructure the shanghai government plans to transform the city into an international transportation hub extensive development plans for the ports air rail and road systems have already begun third party logistic companies given the complex nature of transportation and distribution in china companies may wish to employ a freightforwarder or third party logistic company to assist with the process recent years have seen the chinese market flooded with a variety of small multinational or domestic providers under current chinese regulations with the exception of three third party logistic companies require a jointventure partner to operate nationally in china wholly owned foreign providers can only operate within designated free trade zones under chinas wto accession this restriction is scheduled to be eliminated by the three exceptions include maersk apl and po nedlloyd as with choosing a distributor third party logistics companies should be chosen carefully onsite visits client testimonials wordofmouth client portfolio and infrastructure can assist in discerning the capabilities of the company researching different avenues and providers should be performed before making a final decision the right match will make the difference in the market although the competition is substantial there remains significant opportunity for the right logistics company there are currently over companies registered as logistic providers in the market the majority of these companies offer no more than basic transportation and warehousing facilities their basic understanding of customer service levels and exporters needs are limited third party logistics companies should gear up to offer turnkey solutions with a full range of service possibilities companies that offer unique customized services to small to medium size enterprises should fill in a niche sector of this complex and growing industry air air transport is the quickest and safest mode of transportation it is also the most expensive often breakable highvalue small electronic or rush items are transported by air significant investment has been injected into the air cargo and passenger industry over the last five years the government has newly constructed or renovated over of the national airports across the country the majority of the airports situated in the yangzi delta have been newly built or renovated airport to handle air cargo in the shanghai government opened the firstphase of the pudong international airport the second phase in scheduled to begin in and will further expand the airports handling capacity the major global airlines now have regular routes from shanghai to their respective international destination dhl ups ana and fedex have facilities at the new airport in addition many of chinas domestic airlines have revamped their services and offer enhanced passenger and cargo services the new pudong airport is a muchneeded supplement to the existing hong qiao airport together the two airports handled metric tons of cargo in with hong qiao receiving and pudong receiving cargo handled at pudong increased from while that of hong qiao decreased it is important to note pudong airport only became operational in as the industry develops the shanghai government plans to continue transferring more and more services from the old airport to the new one at the time of publication the hong qiao airport handles the majority of the domestic routes in china water shanghai located at the mouth of the yangzi river is renowned for possessing one of the busiest and most modern ports in china in the shanghai port attracted the highest dollar amount of imports entering china with nanjing jiangsu province in fourth place in recent years shipping facilities operations and customer services have been streamlined allowing for greater efficiency according to shanghai port officials the port handled a record million tons of cargo in a increase from the prior year the major international carriers cosco oocl maersk and apl have regular fixed schedules to shanghai the shanghai port authority is constructing a deepwater port in order to enhance its port handling capabilities and compete with other asian ports as singapore or hong kong at the moment the shanghai port is limited in the size of container ship it can accept as the mouth of the yangzi delta is only metres deep in the port was capable of handling million foot containers in it will handle million containers other renovations and expansion plans are being carried out to other ports through out the country and the region currently there are over ports in operation in china whereas chinas off shore and ocean going shipping has expanded rapidly inland water transportation has slowed in growth inland water transportation lacks the technology and finances to develop they do not possess the capabilities to handle large container ships roadways trucking is the most used form of transportation it is also the most costeffective and efficient eastern coastal cities as shanghai and its neighbouring regional centres are well connected by a series of roads and highways outside these areas the road system requires significant upgrading recognising the need for improvement the state development plan announced an additional kms of new roads of which half will be expressways currently in china there are kms of highways of which only km are expressways the main drawback of the trucking industry is its high degree of decentralisation the average chinese trucking firm owns one truck there is no one national trucking company the decentralised state makes tracking logistics and reliability a challenge in addition corruption and local protectionism continues to hamper the development of a nationwide industry out of province truck drivers are often forced to pay high toll fees and obtain regional licenses local cities have their own distribution system and often accord their companies sole rights for distribution within the city of shanghai main roads are congested and in peak times slow to reduce congestion shanghai plans to construct kilometres of expressway by and kilometres by the city now has about kilometres of expressway in service accessing the city centre and residential districts is still a challenge in an effort to control city transportation large trucks are not allowed within certain areas at certain periods of time special licenses may apply roads in neighbourhoods are relatively small and not built to accommodate large trucks alternative distribution methods include smaller trucks bicycle or motorcycles are used rail traditionally the railway was the most used form of transportation it remains the cheapest form the railway networks covers a large geographic territory all provinces in china are connected through railway rail continues to ship the majority of chinas commodities grains and coal the rail system continues to be overburdened with use transport delays are common the chinas state planning commission announced plans to construct an additional kms of new railway lines the current length is kms of line an intermodal system between various forms of transportation is yet to be widely developed plans to further develop and increase the effectiveness of the intermodal system have been discussed a key drawback to rail transportation is handling of all available modes of transport the damage rate is the highest goods are brought by truck to the station unloaded and switched to rail off loaded at the final destination and loaded on a truck to reach the endcustomer handlers are notorious for mishandling goods in addition another problem occurs as key products as grain and coal often have priority over consumer products • fast • reliable • minimised damage • flexible schedules • negotiable rates • better control over merchandise disadvantage disadvantage • expensive • limits on load size • corruption highway tolls • decentralised • poor inland roads train water benefit benefit • good for bulk goods as commodities • relatively cheap • covers a large geographic territorry • no capacity problems • industry has streamlined tracking system fixed schedules disadvantage disadvantage • slow • bureaucratic • high damage rage • coal and grain have priority • need to book space in advance • not flexible • ill equipped for inland transport packaging given the above transportation infrastructure it is no surprise that goods undergo rough transport and handling good packaging is necessary to protect against the damage goods should be packaged in tamperresistant materials to protect against rough handling and bad weather special arrangements will need to be made for special requirement goods proper labelling on the goods in both english and chinese will facilitate the transportation and import formalities markings on containers should identify the buyer the port of entry gross and net weights the country of origin and any handling cautions fragile refrigerated a packing list identifying the contents of each container must also be included and all markings must agree with those on the bill of lading or other shipment documents food merchandising the retail system over the last decade the chinese retail market has undergone remarkable growth as well as significant profound change the change has accelerated and facilitated the access of imported goods to the end consumer traditionally food products were purchased daily from local wet markets and dry goods from local state–run stores westernstyle retail stores have begun to replace the traditional structure today food retail outfits house flashy displays and a complete set of goods in one location hypermarkets supermarkets and convenience stores have proliferated the city providing convenience reasonable prices and improved sanitary conditions the shanghai consumer has accepted the evolved system with enthusiasm currently there are over retail food outlets over square metres operating in the city of which were established in type of store of stores total sales market sales of store total billion rmb of consumption sales supermarkets bilion rmb convenience stores billion rmb hypermarkets billion rmb fast food outlets billion rmb others billion rmb restaurant and hotels five star hotels standalone five star restaurants and fast food outlets have become and continue to become an integral element of shanghais food industry a vibrant hospitality industry has appeared in recent years catering to chinese and foreign business people residents and tourists the number of visitors business and tourism to shanghai has grown on average a year and is projected to reach million by expo in shanghai attracted million domestic and international travellers to the city in alone the four seasons the hilton the westin the sofitel and the shangrila have all opened new ventures in the city the four and five star hotel tourist and restaurant industry offers one of the largest opportunities for imported foods the need to cater to the varying international cuisine and food preferences of this growing sector has created opportunity and will continue to do so to date imported food products enjoys a high penetration rate and is well accepted with these retailers also end users have the financial capital to purchase the more expensive food hypermarkets and discount warehouse stores hypermarkets are one of the newest market players to the retail industry at their advent on the scene sceptics quickly predicted their failure as chinese traditionally bought daily small purchases the stores ability to offer convenience variety and low prices to the consumer won the loyalty and acceptance today there are over hypermarkets operating in shanghai hypermarkets are normally foreign and joint venture owned defined by size square meters plus and product selection a hypermarket is a large retail concern selling a wide variety of products from frozen goods to household products in one location one floor may also be dedicated to restaurants and services stores are often two or three floors and have extensive frozen food produce fresh meat fresh fish and household sections additional features such as bakeries premade foods and alcoholic beverages are the norm prices are kept down due to the unique nature of their distribution system retail concerns such as carrefour or walmart shanghai opening are now planning to establish a nationwide procurement system to further streamline their operations effective supply chain management systems and foreign expertise also contribute to their success hypermarkets are an important driving force for changes in the industry distributors or importers are forced to update their systems and be effective to supplement their income further hypermarkets charge high slotting fees for goods to be displayed on their shelves the largest foreign presence is french based carrefour carrefour was one of the first retailers to enter the chinese market and to pioneer the hypermarket movement since they have opened stores nationally six of which are in shanghai metro a german based retailer is also prominent in the market at the moment the largest presence of canadian food is available at the hongqiao friendship store local chinese retailers have quickly adjusted to the new process and have entered the market a merger of the four largest shanghai stateowned retail outfits will create significant new competition in the hypermarket and supermarket industry the new bailian group will command billion canadian in assets and possess a distribution network spanning provinces the merger was viewed as necessary to consolidate in order the oversaturated retail industry and to provide significant competition to foreignors though import food selection differs greatly by hypermarkets these outlets are a good entry point for imported food their target market has the disposable income to try new products in addition their streamlined system is relatively easy to access and to navigate at present the imported selection is relatively small but is continually expanding supermarkets the advent of supermarkets in the mid s was the beginning of the retail revolution in shanghai in the first supermarket opened its doors today in there are over supermarkets operating throughout the city representing the most widespread outlet for food procurement the largest supermarket operators are chineseowned companies the top leading companies in shanghai are lianhua and hualian each company also operates a set of convenience stores and hypermarkets lianhua and hualian are now members of the newly formed bailian group store name of stores depending on the store fresh produce and meat can also be purchased in the outlet while some of these retail outfits carry imported food the penetration is rather low foreign brands coke dove kit kat produced in china can be purchased from all stores certain supermarkets as parksons or city supermarket cater solely to expatriate and highincome chinese by carrying exclusively imported products in of supermarkets operated as part of a larger chain the chain store approach facilitates and coordinates distribution stores rely on close relationships with local food distributors the hypermarket distribution system remains the more effective of the two as the retail and distribution system continues to evolve and the acceptance of imported food deepens penetration will also grow at the supermarket level convenience stores cstores convenience stores have and continue to sprout up on every street corner at present there are over stores in shanghai by the estimated number is the majority of shanghais chain stores are locally owned with the exception of a few foreign funded enterprises owns of the lawson stores the convenience store market in shanghai is extremely competitive and has limited room for expansion convenience stores resemble their canadian counterparts offering a selection of convenience foods and groceries at slightly higher prices than supermarkets as in canada they often provide hours services offering an array of hot late night and early morning snack food it is important to note that convenience stores carry a majority of local products or local foreign joint venture products imported products rarely adorn the shelves convenience stores are often operated by larger retail concerns as supermarkets or other food producers for example kedi stores are owned and operated by shanghai bright dairy food corporation the main dairy producer processor and distributor in shanghai lianhua kuaike and hualian lawson also operate a set of convenience chain stores few independent stores exist in the market this link facilitates the distribution of goods as stores tap into the system of their larger counterpart wet markets traditionally wet markets were the main centres for food procurement fresh meat fish vegetables fruit and grain can be purchased from a multitude of different vendors wet markets predominantly cater to the lowincome and older population as prices are low and the produce fresh purchases are generally small and intended only for daily consumption although today wet markets are declining in importance they still remain an important source for food procurement the majority of fruit and vegetable purchases continue to be made at this level wet markets are found throughout shanghai and outlying areas they tend to be located on side streets and back lanes kiosks small kiosks are often found on street corners or hidden in back lanes kiosk shelves are crammed with a miscellaneous assortment of goods neighbourhood patrons or passerbys purchase small convenience goods such as a beverage product cigarettes snacks instant noodles or tissue imported foods have not reached this level of the retail structure purchase amounts are normally quite small as patrons do the majority of their food shopping at bigger retail outlets as the supermarket or hypermarket kiosks are normally owned and operated by independent families family members are responsible for the procurement of the products in their stall accessing and distributing to this sector of the retail section is complicated costly and time consuming the independent nature the size and physical locations of the kiosks makes distribution a key problem department stores modern day department stores similar to the hudsons bay of canada often have one or two floors dedicated to food sales normally department stores are operated as independent units and sell the same products as the supermarkets or hypermarkets the department stores primary purpose is not to sell food products but to sell a host of products from clothing to electronics food retail is an added convenience for the shopper depending on the store a certain degree of mported products are sold in this medium the local consumer the united states department of agriculture usda estimates that imported foods account for less than of food stocks in chinese hypermarkets and supermarkets this percent does not include foreign brands produced in china such as nestlé or cocacola products leading retail chains are beginning to diversify their product range and increasingly carry import foods in general imported food is purchased by the middleupper income younger chinese import food purchases are often made out of curiosity to try something new or as a gift to relatives or friends as a result repeat sales are more difficult to achieve than the first price brand and quality remain the leading decision making factors as any global market consumer preferences need to be closely examined before formulating a market entry strategy canadian exporters are advised to perform thorough market research before entering the market research is needed to clearly understand the end consumer and their preferences a common misconception is that the chinese market in one market in reality it is a series of local regional markets trends vary from one city to another cities to watch are shanghai beijing and guanzhou marketing your product advertisements for coke or pepsi are splashed on the side of buses juicy fruit gum commercials dance across television screens and usa grown oranges are painted on the citys towering billboards the key is to find an outlet and an image that appeals to the chinese consumer developing and marketing a brand is increasingly important creating a recognisable brand will make the difference between success and failure branding is a relatively new concept in chinas retail sector prior to s no real brands existed in the market today brand names have become one of the top decision making factors influencing consumerpurchasing decisions evian water or pringles potato chips are repeatedly chosen over others as consumer identify with the name and quality of the product recognizing the importance chinese producers have also jumped into the game and are building effective brand names for their products premium branding will assist in ensuring repeat purchases of the product an important element of promotion is education western products are often new to chinese culture and taste certain products require significant education for example historically dairy products have been viewed as a supplement for the young weak and elderly the challenge is now in convincing the society of the importance at all age levels a western product may need to employ a different strategy in china for example canadians know and use peanut butter as a spread on bread other key elements of effective marketing are ensuring the product is attractively packaged chinese language information correct and catchy advertisement slogans are used brightly coloured innovative packaging will help differentiate the product on the shelf as the majority of residents walk or bicycle to the store package size should be relatively small special care should be given in translation and chinese language information for example cocacolas success can be attributed partly to its chinese name cokes chinese name is ke kou ke le which means delicious and happiness imported products may consider including chinese language information on its origin potential use and recipes recognising the importance of marketing and promotional activities exporters should not rely on their distributor to provide such service distributors are order takers and do not necessarily have the resources or the money to provide added services exporters may want to develop their own marketing strategy or provide additional finances or promotional material to their distributor to assist in marketing their product instore promotions and taste tests have been successful in introducing products to the market pricing although the shanghainese are among the wealthiest people in china price remains an important factor in their purchasing decision consumers are willing to pay higher prices for imported food as it is often viewed as having higher quality and consumers are curious to try something different imported food should be priced to maintain its exclusivity while at the same time not outside an affordable price range for consumers with exception to certain products as ginseng wine or chocolate where consumers are willing to purchase at much higher prices providing they believe in the quality and value of the product the following table provides the prices on various imports foreign brands locally produced and local products product size importmade in china average price rmb cnd

bottled water ml import nongfu springs ml china cokepepsi ml china dove chocolate gr china belgium chocolate gr import taste creating products that target the chinese taste are key to success significant market research is required to determine and match local consumer preferences for example a leading brands plain potato chip has a small amount of sugar in the ingredients popular chip brands include seaweed shrimp roasted pork or curry whereas in canada they are ketchup and sour cream and onion another example is the popularity of aloe vera yoghurt on the market the chinese eat aloe vera in a variety of dishes and believe in its health benefits though not necessary products catering to local tastes have enjoyed greater success in store requirements inshore promotion has proven to be successful for the promotion of imported products taste tests are a good mechanism to promote the product at the store level food festivals are also popular festivals are organised individually by the store or with the partnership of a private or foreign public actor annually the canadian consulate general in shanghai organises a canadian food festival in one of the leading retail stores in the city the goal of the festival is to promote canadian valueadded food products in shanghai promotion and marketing alone are not always enough to establish a product in the market there are a number of other instore factors that are crucial for success the product must be constantly available stocked in good condition and displayed correctly products requiring cold storage facilities may encounter problems the distributor must constantly maintain relationships with the store and check the status of the product the store will not provide any additional services due diligence on distributors is fundamental if frustrating requirements that will help alleviate this problem it is also a worthy investment to pay the slotting fee for friendly eyelevel shelf space the customer will not be able to miss the product slotting fees are a common practice in china retail outlets and a constant issue between suppliers and retailers the slotting fee is not necessary shelf placement but the right to enter into the stores product portfolio as more and more products rush to the market current rates are increasingly steeply • imported food accounts for of total food stocks in chinese hypermarket and supermarkets • imported brands produced in china have greater success they are able to compete on price market awareness and production costs • price taste and branding are key elements to understanding the shanghainese consumer as any market consumer preferences vary immensely from the canadian market effective and adequate market research should be performed to ensure

markets of india purpose the purpose of this paper is to provide canadian food exporters with indications of opportunities or contestable markets in india the paper uses several indicators of contestability and ranks product groups according to the number of positive indicators associated with each the paper provides indications only individual companies should follow up on opportunities of interest with further market research including the determination of quality and packaging of competing products acquisition of information on sanitaryphytosanitary and labelling requirements the development of a research price workup other barriers to trade and eventually a specific price workup the indicators of contestability used in this paper are based on historical statistics and therefore assume indian tastes and preferences are fixed it also assumes that the images that indian consumers have of canada and canadian products are fixed and not always positive relative to the images of competing products the branding strategy for the canadian agriculture and food sector is designed to improve knowledge of canadian products and food systems to differentiate canada from its competitors and establish a reputation for high quality this program can have a major positive influence on indian acceptance of canadian food products and increase the probabilities of finding opportunities in indian markets business paradigms there are several ways in which canadian companies can participate in the food markets of india some understanding of the competitive nature of the indian food markets is necessary for canadian companies to decide on the appropriate paradigm for them a the competitive environment in the packaged food market was dominated by a few multinational companies and many local manufacturers there was also a thriving unorganised sector consisting of many small entities the market was highly competitive and fragmented even the large multinationals had to fight hard to maintain market positions as the rural areas became increasingly important companies engaged in various promotional offers smaller packs at low prices were key to growth in sales of such products as bakery products soup noodles and confectionery products b pure export the paradigm assumed in this paper is characterised by production in canada by canadian companies with sea or air transport to india by any available carrier canadian companies normally cease to be interested in a shipment when it is loaded onto a ship and payment is received c export with agreements this paradigm is much the same as pure export except that canadian companies enter into various kinds of agreements with indian companies to perform any one or more marketing functions such as wholesaling storage distributing advertising andor retailing multinationals operate as if there were no borders placing production plants in the most economic position in relation to sources of inputs and the markets to be served tariffs and other trade barriers are a cost of doing business and influence the placement of production plants based only on economic and financial considerations with barriers to trade falling these companies are in the best position to adjust and benefit from the comparative advantages of many countries some multinational companies active in india are it has a significant presence in bakery products particularly biscuits in early cadbury schweppes of the uk obtained of the shares of cadbury india ltd in the uk company obtained the remaining and delisted the shares the

geography india is located in southern asia with the arabian sea to the west the bay of bengal to the east and the indian ocean to the south on the northwest it is bordered by pakistan on the north by china nepal and bhutan with an area of km it is almost onethird the size of canada india can be divided into three main regions the himalayan mountains the gangetic plain and peninsular india the himalayan mountains the himalayan mountain system is to km wide and extends km along the northern and eastern borders of india it includes the mountains surrounding the vale of kashmir in the karakoram range and the central and eastern himalayas ancient geological forces moulded the himalayas as the indian plate of the earth’s crust subducted under the eurasian landmass creating an uplift that continues to push this northernmost boundary of india ever higher the himalayan range is the highest mountain system in the world the himalayan region including the foothills is sparsely settled agriculture and animal herding are the main economic activities the gangetic plain south of and parallel to the himalayas lies the gangetic plain a belt of flat alluvial lowlands to km wide this area includes some of the most agriculturally productive land in india the indian portion of the broad gangetic plain encompasses several river systems and stretches from punjab state in the west to the assam valley in the east marking the western end of the gangetic plain are the indus river and its tributaries including the sutlej and chenab rivers which flow through punjab in india’s northwest corner the gangetic plain is formed by the ganges river and its tributaries which drain the southern slopes of the himalayas the assam valley is separated from the gangetic plain by a narrow corridor of land near the city of darjeeling the valley is watered by the brahmaputra river which rises in tibet and crosses into india at its northeast corner then flows north of the khasi hills into peninsular india south of the plains region lies peninsular india the northern peninsula features a series of mountain ranges and plateaus the aravalli range runs in a northsouth direction on the eastern edge of the thar desert and low hills cut by valleys lie along the border between the states of uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh in central india the narmada river flows southwest between the vindhya range and an associated plateau on the north and the satpura range on the south the plains of the chota nagpur plateau in the eastern states of chhattisgarh and jharkhand also lie within this region the rocky and uneven lands of the northern peninsula are sparsely populated herding is a major occupation in the west and farming of coarse grains such as millet is common in the central part in the southern part of peninsular india lies the vast deccan plateau a tableland lying within a triangle formed by the satpura range the steep mountain slopes of the western ghats and the gentler slopes of the eastern ghats elevations in the plateau region average m although outcroppings as high as m occur at their northern end the western ghats vary in height from to m but the nilgiri hills of the extreme south reach a height of m at doda betta their highest peak the eastern ghats lie along the eastern flank of the deccan plateau interrupted by the krishna and godavari river basins the indian peninsula is bordered by a mostly fertile seashore the west coast including the extensive gujarat plain in the north the thin konkan shore in maharashtra state and the malabar coast in the south support substantial populations of farmers and fishermen ancient trade routes to the west helped make the cities and towns of this region into market centers for textiles and spices the east

and growing population is the fundamental social economic and environmental problem in late december a major tsunami hit and destroyed part of the southern and eastern coasts of india taking at least lives caused massive destruction of property and severely affected the fishing fleet determinants of food demand quantitatively the rate of increase in the effective demand for agricultural agrifood seafood products is influenced by the rates of change of population product prices income per person and income distribution qualitatively the types of products demanded by consumers are determined by their tastes and preferences which are in turn influenced by the cultures that make up today’s india and their knowledge and acceptance of foreign cuisines income level also has an important influence on the level of quality demanded between and the indian population was increasing at a rate of per year according to data from the office of the registrar general and the reserve bank of india gdp per person was cad in world bank data indicates that it was usd cad in and between and the gdp per person grew at a rate of per year income was less equally distributed individually and geographically

data is available bihar had the lowest average net state domestic product nsdp per person of cad in goa had the highest nsdp per person of cad consumer prices are estimated to be increasing at an annual rate of determinants of food imports many factors influence the amount of food imported into a country including total food demand productive capacity exchange rate movements and various trade barriers the capacity of a country to produce food is in turn influenced by the agricultural and fishery resources it possesses the levels of technology and the number of managers with modern management skills time figure exchange rate between the indian rupee and the canadian dollar cad per inr india is a major food consumer due to the size of its population based on the continuing rapidly increase in population and the increase of gdp or nsdp per person the effective demand for food can be expected to continue to increase the major source of supply will continue to be the indian economy but imports will increase as the indian middle class expands receives higher incomes and become increasingly eclectic in its tastes this is occurring rapidly in some states from january to october the value of the inr see figure was decreasing at a rate of per month per year this slow decrease in value was making canadian food products increasingly expensive for indian consumers although the slow rate may have allowed the indian economy to adjust having only a small effect on food imports before the s india was heavily dependent on food imports today it is not only selfsufficient in grain production but has a substantial reserve the progress made by indian agriculture in the s s and s has been one of the biggest success stories since independence in the s there was a multifold increase in wheat production which became known as the green revolution this increase in agricultural production was accomplished by bringing additional land under cultivation

on the pacific coast new zealand’s export economy is heavily reliant the agricultural sector new zealand’s closely tied with australia both countries share trade agreements and mutual policies and regulations in regards to importing and marketing guidelines their close proximity and shared colonial ties has developed into a very strong interdependent market that can in certain instances be hard to penetrate however due to open trading policies exporting to new zealand is reasonably straightforward and relatively free of heavy tariffs in addition new zealand maintains very friendly ties with the markets of british commonwealth including canada canada – new zealand relations new zealand and canada share excellent and longstanding relationship both countries are part of the british commonwealth and share british colonial roots trade allowances within the commonwealth provide preference towards canadiannew zealand bilateral trade against noncommonwealth trading partners new

economy being one of the smallest but fastest growing economies in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd new zealand’s economy is highly dependant on the export of agricultural products new zealand has experienced a growth in overall industrialization in the past years and is heavily dependant on commodity trade to drive its economy no longer reliant on concessionary british market access new zealand has developed a free market economy that is resilient with promises by government to increase expenditures on health education and pensions as output continues to grow in the budgetary surplus stands at of overall gdp although consumer confidence has fallen in the past few years on the whole consumers remain reasonably optimistic commodity prices are still close to record highs which is providing support to farmers incomes consumer market the new zealand consumer market is a small but prosperous million people with busier onthego lifestyles convenience foods and prepackaged foods are increasingly attractive the market itself has seen a drop in fertility rates as well as an overall aging of the population canadian exporters can expect further growth in these areas new zealand’s small population is quite diverse as a result of these busier lifestyles prepackaged and convenience foods are becoming increasingly attractive new zealand’s older consumers typically have a higher level of disposable income and a product’s perceived quality has become a key purchase decision influencer products and services marketed toward this demographic such as specialised health foods will have a higher rate of success than those marketed to the younger demographic with less disposable income a smaller yet significant number will shop once every two weeks especially those who live in rural areas food is primarily purchased from large supermarket chains urban dwellers have access to a large variety of supermarket chains while rural shoppers have a somewhat limited choice of supermarkets in their vicinity independent food markets thrive in these regions as the population base does not have the numbers necessary to support large supermarket chains small shopping trips throughout the week are primarily made by those who shop once every two weeks these trips are usually made to purchase such perishables as milk eggs and bread between and average weekly grocery spending has risen from nz to nz an increase of roughly to cdn a rise in food expenditure levels can be attributed to the rise in inflation levels the level of expenditure on foods prepared outside of the home is highly dependent on income the households in the top income brackets spend on average nz per week on food prepared outside of the home while households in the lowest income brackets average just nz per week foods prepared outside of the home takeaway foods and pre prepared grocery meals along with meat sweet products spreads and beverages have made the most increases in weekly food expenditures since these products have had a overall increase in market share the united states and the united kingdom round out the top three agriculture exporters to new zealand with neighbouring pacificasian states also ranking high as they continue to build on their share of the new zealand food import market canadian exporters also face intense competition from new zealands domestic manufacturers as local food and beverage industries concentrate on improving and diversifying domestic production to increase their share of the food market at home and in the global market access issues new zealand is an open market with relatively low tariffs placed on agricultural imports certain areas are under quarantine in regards to importing certain animal and agricultural products however this is the only significant barrier to trade in this country new zealand also plans on phasing out most tariffs by an initiative due in part to their association with the world trade organization wto compliance with the new zealand food standards and labeling regulations is of paramount importance and canadian exporters should familiarize themselves with these guidelines particularly the joint food standards code new zealand shares with australia this code sets regulations for food entering both australia and new zealand these regulations can be found at httpwwwfoodstandardsgovaufoodstandardscode as well canadian exporters should team up with a customs broker to ensure conformity to all other regulations in effect more information can be found at the new zealand customs service website at httpwwwcustomsgovtnzimportersdefaultasp canadian exporters are encouraged to register with the virtual trade commissioner service

per person per month • visitor visas are not required however if you intend to do business in new zealand you will require a visa because of fertile geography agriculture has historically been at the forefront of the new zealand economy this shift is related to an increase in dairy prices and a decrease in sheep and cattle prices further subsidies for farmers were removed in and since then livestock producersfarmers have been subject to a more competitive market where prices fluctuate main dairy regions include waikato taranaki and southland at the bottom of the south island beef cattle and sheep farms are stationed primarily in the far north regions of the country an interesting trend on the increase is hobby food standards australia new zealand po box wellington new zealand phone

are a number of trends and changes in hong kong’s consumer market that are currently impacting exporters’ approaches to entering the marketplace hong kong’s residents are becoming increasingly busier often working more than hour day work weeks and are therefore fuelling growth in the foodservice packaged processed and convenience food sectors with a number of food safety and health scares in asia over the past several years consumers have become more health conscious and aware of the benefits associated with healthy eating and lifestyles hong kong’s residents are extremely sensitive to food safety issues and generally prefer fresh food products over prepackaged and processed foods therefore major opportunities for canadian agrifood exporters may include offering highquality organic natural and healthy convenience foods hong kong residents are also very concerned with their overall appearance and wellbeing many consumers try to improve their health or image by turning to health foods for general wellness disease prevention and nutritional benefits organic foods are also in greater demand since food crises plagued the state and genetically modified foods have come under

breakfast cereals biscuits yogurt and soup have become increasingly popular consumer expenditure totalled billion in and is expected to rise approximately to reach billion by overall spending on less nutritious food and beverages seems to be decreasing as consumers become more health conscious with healthier food options making up the bulk of such goods being purchased a decrease in the consumption of chocolate pastries canned or preserved meat and vegetables and butter in recent years exemplifies this trend specific agrifood products that hold strong opportunities in the hong kong marketplace include instant and canned soup and noodles plain noodles and dried pasta frozen desserts readymeals bakery products and processed fish and seafood products and flavoured alcoholic beverages and cider perry breakfast cereals readytodrink coffee spreadable fats and oils yogurt cheese and milk sauces dressings and condiments chips nuts and biscuits and canned or preserved fish and seafood are also expected to show considerable growth • approximately of consumer expenditure was allocated to the purchase of food and nonalcoholic beverages in • in consumers spent billion on food and nonalcoholic beverages this value is expected to increase by to reach billion by • dining outside of the home is extremely popular in hong kong as the state is regarded as a food paradise offering a wide selection of cuisines from around the world • due to mainland china’s lower standard of living more and more hong kong natives are travelling onshore to purchase their groceries at cheaper prices in turn this has slightly affected packaged and processed food sales in hong this growth is constant despite continuing cases of avian influenza throughout certain parts of asia the price of poultry is presumed to appeal more to the majority of consumers than those of other red and white meats • eggs are also popular in hong kong with approximately units per capita consumed in a increase

their busy lifestyles open markets are still common for fresh food purchases however with the emergence of many large supermarkets and convenience stores increasingly large amounts of consumers especially younger shoppers are turning to such modern formats to purchase groceries this has further increased the popularity of modern retail over outdoor markets which are typically only open in the morning however shoppers are more selective and price conscious due to poor economic conditions over the past few years as chinese become increasingly busier and health conscious they are dining more at restaurants and purchasing larger amounts of readytoeat takeaway and fast foods such formats allow for convenience and offer consumers many healthy food options although the sars epidemic had decreased regular spending on eating out in expenditure in this area has rebounded in recent years fullservice restaurants account for of the billion or of consumer food expenditure annually spent by consumers on food for consumption outside of the home competitors as a member of the asiapacific economic cooperation apec hong kong relies heavily on its many asiapacific neighbours as import sources making the territory a more challenging market for canadian products and companies to penetrate hong kong’s principal agrifood import sources china united states brazil denmark and thailand represent canada’s top competition in the hong kong export market furthermore hong kong’s cepa with china also influences the number of exports that enter the state as hong kong acts as a major transhipment point for exports destined for china in fact almost of all food products imported into hong kong are in turn shipped to guangdong china a key entrypoint for chinese imports access issues hong kong remains a destination of constant trade and investment interest for foreign investors and holds strong potential for canadian companies wanting to penetrate the chinese andor asian market to facilitate successful market entry canadian exporters are encouraged to develop market entry strategies that include working with local importers and distributors to develop a presence gain valuable market advice and best position products to meet local tastes laws and pricing • canadian exporters must ensure that their hong kong counterparts declare their imports to the hong kong customs and excise department within days of receiving goods • hong kong collects a trade declaration tax of hk ie for shipments valued under hk ie and an extra hk ie for each additional value of ie on all imports except transhipments • import licences health certificates and other documents may be required for agrifood exports canadian exporters should consult their importer on the necessary paperwork prior to shipment • due to health and safety reasons game meat poultry milk frozen confectionary fish and seafood products and live plants and animals require import permits andor health certificates

kong business customs are similar to those in north america however a good understanding of the differences is important for successful market entry • accept and offer business cards with both hands and make sure to study them for a few seconds before putting them carefully away it is recommended that canadians offer bilingual englishcantonese business cards to their counterparts • offering small gifts to chinese business people is welcomed although not necessary never give a clock handkerchief umbrella or white flowers as these items signify tears andor death fruit and items that are not available in hong kong are best eg canadian coins stamps coffee table books gifts should always be politely accepted although never opened in front of the giver • english and cantonese are the official languages in hong kong cantonese is widely spoken although most business can be conducted in english • chinese may ask their business counterparts personal questions regarding their age marital and family status as this is not considered impolite in hong kong • normal business hours run from am to pm monday through friday and am to pm on saturday punctuality is very important in hong

wine dried grapes and pharmaceutical plants economy the afghan economy is dominated by smallfarm agriculture with a lack of strong central governance the reported national economy represents only a fraction of actual economic activity currently as much as of economic activity remains informal before the collapse of manufacturing the sector was predominately focused on processing agricultural products production has since dropped to less than of the country’s production levels current economic conditions major impediments to afghan economic growth include intermittent electrical power which is only focused around major urban areas a weak and mainly inaccessible telephone network as well as an unstable and dangerous transportation infrastructure • gdp growth was still healthy but fell to in restricted by drought since afghanistan’s per capita gdp has doubled to reach us or us ppp major economic centres include kabul kandahar herat jalalabad and mazaresharif economic

area of future growth however much foreign investment interest is still needed for the industry to see considerable expansion to date risk assessments of the mining sector have limited investment it is widely believed that with expanded security and improved transport infrastructure this sector will be one of the country’s leading earners in the future • international pledges made by more than countries and international financial institutions for reconstruction in march reached us billion for international donors and agencies have turned their focus toward developmental goals the afghanistan national developmental strategy ands is a plan for mediumterm development that will replace the interim afghanistan national developmental strategy iands which focused on provision of basic services such as electricity and education trade historically afghanistan has relied on traditional trade routes and longterm regional trade partners for its import suppliers and export markets outside of its region the country has been renowned internationally for select products such as rugscarpets and certain agricultural products eg pistachios raisins and pomegranates legal trade during the s was dominated by the reexport of products to pakistan and other neighbouring countries many of these goods originally entered dutyfree from pakistan under the pakistanafghanistan trade and transit agreement when pakistan clamped down on the types of goods permitted dutyfree transit in transporting of the goods through iran and the gulf increased significantly more recently trade with nato countries participating in afghan operations has supplimented traditonal trade partners • in exports were valued at us million and were comprised of fruits and nuts handwoven carpets wool cotton hides and pelts and precious and semiprecious gems afghanistan’s largest export markets in were the united states india pakistan and finland afghanistan had a trade deficit of over us billion in in imports were valued at us billion and were comprised of capital goods agricultural inputs rice wheat textiles and petroleum products eg fuel and cooking oil while agricultural products still dominate exports they have become an increasingly large component of total imports in agricultural products made up between and of the country’s total imports agricultural products accounted for about of afghanistans exports in nuts and fruit including pistachios almonds grapes melons apricots cherries figs mulberries and pomegranates are among afghanistan’s most important exports key afghan agricultural products maintain a very high international image particularly in india and building on this image will be a key to recreating the once strong export sector apart from development goals it appears that afghanistan and its regiontraditional export markets are seeking to put in place the framework for a return to normalcy as soon as afghanistan regains its supply capabilities • afghanistan has signed bilateral trade and economic cooperation agreements with russia and turkey afghanistan has also signed a bilateral reciprocal promotion and protection of investments agreement with turkey and a bilateral preferential trade agreement with india afghanistan is a member of the following trade organizations • economic cooperation organization eco central asia regional economic cooperation carec south asian association for regional cooperation saarc afghanistan receives special access to several western markets based on its status as a leastdeveloped country • duty free and quota free access to canada • generalized preferences treatment with japan competition domestic competition for quality western goods is limited and imports will dominate this market for some time to come competition for general consumer goods comes primarily for cheap lowquality goods from iran and pakistan these products enter the country easily and are sold through sales and distribution networks that would be near impossible for an outsider to access • german products have a long history in the market and continue to succeed germany’s relationship with afghanistan predates the russian invasion population three decades of conflict and natural disasters led to millions of afghans fleeing to neighbouring iran and pakistan and a million more internallydisplaced within afghanistan since between and million afghan refugees have returned to their country and over internally displaced people have returned to their home towns and villages it is estimated that as many as million afghan refugees currently remain in pakistan and iran current population figures for afghanistan vary greatly a asia development bank estimate states the population is roughly million while the cia world fact book states the total is closer to million there are estimates from various sources which mirror or fall between these two values approximations have obviously been affected by a number of factors such as a thirtyyear gap in solid national governance for statistics purposes conflict deaths refugees both fleeing and returning and a largely rural population including nomads which are difficult to account for generally municipal figures are considered more accurate afghanistan has communities of various sizes afghanistan is an islamic country of the population is sunni while the remainder of the population is predominately shia islamic religious tradition and codes together with traditional tribal and ethnic practices have an important role in personal conduct and dispute settlement afghan society is largely based on kinship groups which follow traditional customs and religious practices though somewhat less so in urban areas • the work force is estimated at million unemployment is estimated at of the population lives below the poverty line most rural inhabitants are farmers or farm labourers essentially of the afghan population depends on the agriculture sector for its livelihood the average age of afghan farmers is roughly years nonfarmers face very low income potential even skilled professionals find only low pay available police are reportedly being paid us a month while it has been reported that doctors in some areas can receive as little as us when compared to the us taliban fighters reportedly receive for their efforts the reason for the continuing popularity of the insurgents in some areas is obvious consumers much of the population continues to suffer from shortages of housing clean water electricity medical care and employment it will probably take the remainder of the decade and continuing donor aid and attention to significantly raise afghanistans living standards from its current status among the lowest in the world overall literacy rates are low at while that of males and females is estimated at and respectively however since aid and development projects have targeted this issue and schools in kandahar now in operation rural consumption of meat vegetables and fruit is limited afghans have a cerealheavy diet retail a return to normalcy in traditional afghan markets has been seen by many as one of the true positive developments since retail trade in afghanistan is unlike its western counterparts but all indications point to the fact that an active central market in a city town or village is an excellent economic indicator and speaks to a heightened sense of security amongst local consumers • formal distribution and sales channels are not well developed most commerce is limited to small store fronts urban markets and road side trading agriculture sector policies overview agriculture continues to be the backbone of the afghan economy while arable land accounts for only of the available land area the sector was able to be almost entirely self– sufficient and a net exporter of many highvalue commodities over the last three decades cultivated land area has declined by half to just of the country because of population dislocation land mines drought and damage to centuriesold irrigation infrastructure • agriculture currently employs of the population and contributes to roughly to of the country’s gdp prior to decades of conflict afghanistan had a largely selfsufficient and export capable agriculture sector the sector produced roughly of its wheat and rye requirements and produced surpluses of rice potatoes pulses nuts and seeds horticultural crops specifically pistachios citrus fruits figs dates and almonds once accounted for between and of the country’s export earnings however current agricultural production is a fraction of its potential a sector that was traditionally selfsufficient has been reduced to in some regions agricultural production had all but ceased due to destruction caused by the war and the migration of afghans out of those areas land mines and a lack of irrigation have taken thousands of hectares of agricultural land out of production apart from conflictrelated issues the sector has traditionally been constrained by an almost total dependence on erratic winter snows and spring rains for water drought is always a concern irrigation was primitive before the series of conflicts took place and now it is essentially in ruins the sector has never modernized or implemented modern techniques and as a result has very little experience with machines chemical fertilizers or pesticides current issues facing the sector include limited natural fresh water resources soil degradation and overgrazing despite irrigation’s positive impact the dated technology operates at an estimated efficiency droughts are a regular occurrence and typically affect the sector through mild droughts every two to three years and severe droughts every years wheat currently makes up of all grain production in the years directly following nato involvement in the country wheat production has increased considerably in the wheat crop grew by almost over the level achieved in the variety of the countrys crops corresponds to its topography • the areas around kandahar herat and the broad kabul plain yield a variety of fruit the northern regions from takhar to badghis and herat and helmand provinces produce cotton corn is grown extensively in paktia and nangarhar provinces many farms are still listed as little more than subsistence level and as such too small to positively impact domestic needs while individual debt is under per debtor interest rates can be as high as and is roughly a years wage for many afghans planningdevelopment the immediate plan for the sector involves a number of key issues which have been supported by and contributed to by the world’s leading agricultural organizations through detailed actions which involve a sectorbysector plan engaging communities government and the private sector the afghan government envisions a sector that can poppies afghanistan is currently the world’s largest producer of opium the country’s opium gdp is estimated at of the total economy and of illicit gdp poppy production is centred in two provinces in the south where insurgents are at their strongest expanding poppy cultivation and a growing opium trade generate roughly us billion in illicit economic activity and looms as one of kabuls most serious policy concerns afghanistan’s president calls the opium trade his country’s worst enemy cultivation dropped in but this was due to weather not success shifting agricultural producers away from poppy production better weather and lack of widespread disease returned opium yields to normal levels in and the opium harvest up over in effect when combined with aid dollars opium is putting too much money into the economy poppy farmers are generally deeply indebted to regional war lords and with minimal security in certain areas most farmers have no choice but to grow poppies to pay back their debts it must also be considered that the power of regional warlords may make the choice to stop producing poppies difficult these are all key factors in the minimal success todate in endingreducing poppy production it is interesting to note that even the repressive taliban regime gave up on its efforts to ban the production of opium because of the near impossibilityunpopularity of the initiative regardless of the moralsocial issues most experts believe that destroying the opium economy would have a devastating impact unless it was preceded or accompanied by decades of development so many people are reliant on funds from poppies that stopping the practice dead would leave thousands if not millions without income agrifood past present future report taiwan february february taiwan past present future report february overview taiwan has the second highest population density in the

encourage consumers to recreate different pasta dishes at home product education for example through recipe distribution may be useful to increase knowledge and interest in different types of pasta

supermarketshypermarkets seldom have discounts on pasta and private label products mainly targeted to lower income groups and are therefore not popular at these particular outlets as the premium price product is a pour match for the typical consumers at these retail chains an increase in the distribution channels of pasta could in turn increase convenience for consumers selling pasta in independent food stores and discounters may achieve success in reaching a wider more lowerincome consumer base while still a very small export value for canada totals have risen from less than in to over in
